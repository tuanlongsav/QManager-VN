# QManager Backend Reference

**Target platforms:** QManager targets the broader Quectel ARMv7-on-modem ecosystem, not a single SKU. Two SoC families are in scope:

- **SDXLEMUR (5G Modem-RF System)** — X62 silicon (RM520N-GL, the dev device for this branch) and X65 silicon (RM521F). The SoC codename `SDXLEMUR` reported by `/proc/cpuinfo` covers both; firmware is built from the SDX65 SDK regardless (`LE.UM.6.3.6.r1-02600-SDX65.0` on the dev device), which is why the OEM build string mentions `SDX65` even on the X62 part.
- **SDXPRAIRIE** — X55 silicon (RG502Q-EA, RM502Q-AE). Quirks unique to this family are called out where they differ (notably `/dev/smd11` re-creation timing, see [§8 udev Rules](#8-udev-rules)).

Probe data in this document was collected on an RM520N-GL (X62, SDXLEMUR, ARMv7l Cortex-A7 single-core, kernel `5.4.210-perf`, glibc 2.31, distro `qti-distro-nogplv3-perf` `LE.UM.6.3.6.r1-02600-SDX65.0`, 178 MB RAM, ~91 MB zram swap, `/tmp` 89 MB tmpfs). PRAIRIE devices report different OEM strings but share the same Quectel userspace conventions (BusyBox-1.31 toolchain, bash 3.2, systemd 244, Entware armv7sf-k3.2). Where this doc says "the platform", read it as "this Quectel-on-modem userspace stack" unless a SDK-specific note is called out.
This document is a developer reference for the shell-script backend. It covers every library, daemon, unit file, sudoers rule, udev rule, CGI endpoint, and file path that exists in this codebase. It does not cover frontend React code, installer operational flow, or platform internals.

## 1. Overview

QManager runs as a self-contained web management stack inside the RM520N-GL modem itself. The modem runs vanilla Debian-adjacent Linux (not OpenWRT). QManager installs independently under `/usrdata/qmanager/` with no dependency on the OEM SimpleAdmin panel.

**Platform stack:**

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Init system | systemd 244 (`-PAM -SECCOMP -APPARMOR`, hybrid cgroup v1+v2) |
| Web server | lighttpd 1.4.82 (Entware, `/opt/sbin/lighttpd`) |
| Package manager | Entware opkg at `/opt/` (Entware libc 2.27 alongside system glibc 2.31) |
| Config store | JSON files under `/etc/qmanager/` (no UCI) |
| AT transport | `atcli_smd11` via `/dev/smd11` (direct, no socat) |
| Firewall | iptables 1.8.4 legacy (direct, no nftables/fw4) |
| Shell | `/bin/sh` is **BusyBox `ash`** (`/bin/sh -> busybox.nosuid`); `/bin/bash` exists but is **bash 3.2.57(1)-release** — see [§14 Common Pitfalls](#14-common-pitfalls) for missing modern bashisms |

**Backend layers (source to device):**

```
CGI scripts (lighttpd) -- scripts/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/
     |
Shared libraries       -- scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/
     |
Shell daemons          -- scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_*
     |
AT command gatekeeper  -- scripts/usr/bin/qcmd -> atcli_smd11 -> /dev/smd11
     |
systemd services       -- scripts/etc/systemd/system/
     |
sudoers rules          -- scripts/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager
udev rules             -- scripts/etc/udev/rules.d/
```

`scripts/` in the repository mirrors the device filesystem. `install_rm520n.sh` copies these files to their target paths on the device.

---

## 2. Critical Constraints

These constraints cause silent failures or security issues if violated.

**LF line endings mandatory.** `.gitattributes` enforces LF for all `.sh`, `.service`, and `sudoers` files. CRLF in shell scripts causes BusyBox/bash parse failures. CRLF in sudoers rules causes silent sudo rejection. The installer runs `sed -i 's/\r$//'` on deployed files as a second safety net, but the source must be LF.

**Atomic writes are universal.** Every file that is polled by another process (status JSON, config, state files) must be written via a temporary file plus `mv`. Never truncate-in-place. This prevents readers from seeing partial JSON during writes.

**`fs.protected_regular=1` is active.** The kernel prevents a root process from truncating a file owned by a different user in a sticky `/tmp` directory. This means: if a CGI script (www-data) creates `/tmp/foo.json`, the poller (root) cannot later open it for truncation. Workaround patterns:
- `qmanager_setup` pre-creates shared `/tmp` files as `www-data:www-data` mode 666 at boot.
- For files written exclusively by root, pre-create them as `root:root` mode 666.
- For worker scripts that need to reset their own log, use `rm -f` then create fresh (as seen in `qmanager_update`).

**`/bin/bash` is bash 3.2.57 — many "modern" bashisms are missing.** Probe-confirmed unsupported in this version:
- `${var,,}` / `${var^^}` (lowercase/uppercase substitution) — **broken**, use `tr` instead
- `mapfile` / `readarray` — **not built-in**, use `while read` loops
- `wait -n` (wait for any child) — **not supported**
- `declare -A` (associative arrays) — **not supported**, use parallel indexed arrays or temp files

Probe-confirmed supported: `<<<` herestring, `[[ =~ ]]` regex with `$BASH_REMATCH`, indexed arrays, `local`, `[[ ]]`, process substitution `<(...)`. **`/bin/sh` is BusyBox `ash`** — POSIX-only by definition; do **not** assume any bashism in `#!/bin/sh` scripts. Libraries sourced by both contexts must stay POSIX-clean.

**AT commands via `qcmd` only.** Never write directly to `/dev/smd11`. `qcmd` provides flock serialization. Concurrent writes to `/dev/smd11` corrupt modem responses.

**`jq //` (alternative operator) treats `false` as absent.** `false // "default"` returns `"default"`. When reading boolean config fields (like `enabled`), use the explicit null check pattern:

```sh
val=$(jq -r '(.field) | if . == null then "false" else tostring end' file.json)
```

**CGI privilege model.** lighttpd runs CGI as `www-data`. All privileged operations (service control, iptables, reboot) require `sudo -n` with full absolute paths. The `platform.sh` library provides sudo-wrapped helpers (`svc_*`, `run_iptables`, `run_reboot`). The sudoers file whitelists exactly these paths.

**`systemctl enable` does not work on RM520N-GL.** Unit files live on a read-only rootfs partition where `systemctl enable` cannot write symlinks. Boot persistence uses direct symlinks in `/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/`. Use `svc_enable`/`svc_disable` from `platform.sh` which write the symlinks directly via `sudo /bin/ln -sf` / `sudo /bin/rm -f`.

---

## 3. Source Tree Layout

All paths are relative to the repository root. The source tree mirrors the device filesystem exactly.

| Source path | Device path | Contents |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `scripts/usr/bin/` | `/usr/bin/` | Daemon and utility scripts (qcmd, qmanager_*) |
| `scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/` | `/usr/lib/qmanager/` | Shared shell libraries |
| `scripts/etc/systemd/system/` | `/lib/systemd/system/` | Systemd unit files |
| `scripts/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager` | `/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager` (also `/opt/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager`) | Sudoers rules for www-data |
| `scripts/etc/udev/rules.d/99-qmanager-smd11.rules` | `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-qmanager-smd11.rules` | udev rule for /dev/smd11 |
| `scripts/etc/udev/scripts/qmanager_smd11_udev.sh` | `/usr/lib/qmanager/qmanager_smd11_udev.sh` | udev helper script |
| `scripts/etc/qmanager/` | `/etc/qmanager/` | Persistent config and state (template files) |
| `scripts/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/` | `/usrdata/qmanager/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/` | CGI scripts |
| `scripts/usrdata/qmanager/lighttpd.conf` | `/usrdata/qmanager/lighttpd.conf` | lighttpd configuration (ends with an `include_shell` that optionally pulls in gzip config) |
| _(generated at install time)_ | `/usrdata/qmanager/lighttpd-deflate.conf` | gzip/`mod_deflate` snippet — `install_backend()` auto-installs the module (`opkg install --nodeps`, runs on OTA too), writes this file, then validates with `lighttpd -tt` and reverts (rm) if it can't load. Absent ⇒ no compression, never a brick. Not shipped in the tarball. |
| `scripts/usrdata/qmanager/console/` | `/usrdata/qmanager/console/` | Web console (ttyd) |
| `dependencies/atcli_smd11` | `/usr/bin/atcli_smd11` | AT CLI binary (Rust, ARMv7 static) |
| `dependencies/sms_tool` | `/usr/bin/sms_tool` | SMS send/receive binary (ARMv7) |
| `dependencies/ttyd` | `/usrdata/qmanager/console/ttyd` | Web terminal binary (ARMv7) |

**Note on `qmanager_smd11_udev.sh`:** The source path (`scripts/etc/udev/scripts/`) is deliberately outside `scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/` to prevent the installer's glob copy from resetting its execute bit to 644. The installer copies it to `/usr/lib/qmanager/` with explicit `chmod +x`.

---

## 4. Shared Libraries

All libraries live at `/usr/lib/qmanager/` on the device. Each uses a guard variable to prevent double-sourcing (e.g., `[ -n "$_CGI_BASE_LOADED" ] && return 0`). Source order matters: `qlog.sh` should be sourced before any library that calls `qlog_*`.

### 4.1 `cgi_at.sh`

AT command helpers for CGI scripts and daemons. Source after `qlog.sh` or `cgi_base.sh`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `strip_at_response <raw>` | Remove command echo, `OK`, and `ERROR` lines from a raw qcmd response |
| `run_at <at_command>` | Execute an AT command via qcmd; returns stripped response or rc=1 on error |
| `detect_active_cid` | Determine active WAN CID via `AT+CGPADDR;+QMAP="WWAN"`; sets global `active_cid` |
| `parse_cgdcont <raw>` | Parse `AT+CGDCONT?` response into a JSON array `[{cid, pdp_type, apn}]` |
| `validate_imei <imei>` | Validate that imei is exactly 15 decimal digits; returns 0/1 |
| `wait_modem_ready <seconds>` | Block for N seconds to allow AT interface to stabilise after boot |

### 4.2 `cgi_auth.sh`

Cookie-based authentication library. Sourced automatically by `cgi_base.sh`. Storage:
- `/etc/qmanager/auth.json` — password hash + salt (SHA-256, persistent)
- `/tmp/qmanager_sessions/<token>` — one file per session (RAM, cleared on reboot)
- `/tmp/qmanager_auth_attempts.json` — rate limiting state (5 attempts / 5-minute window)

Session tokens are 64-char hex strings (256 bits). Session TTL is 3600 seconds.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `is_setup_required` | Returns 0 if `auth.json` is missing or empty (first-run state) |
| `qm_generate_salt` | Generate a 32-char hex salt from `/dev/urandom` |
| `qm_hash_password <pw> <salt>` | SHA-256 hash of `salt+password` |
| `qm_timing_safe_compare <a> <b>` | Constant-time string comparison via awk |
| `qm_verify_password <pw>` | Verify password against stored hash+salt in `auth.json` |
| `qm_save_password <pw>` | Hash and persist a new password to `auth.json` (chmod 600) |
| `qm_get_cookie <name>` | Extract named cookie value from `$HTTP_COOKIE` |
| `qm_set_session_cookies <token>` | Emit `Set-Cookie` headers for session + indicator cookies |
| `qm_clear_session_cookies` | Emit `Set-Cookie` headers that expire both cookies |
| `qm_generate_token` | Generate a 64-char hex session token |
| `qm_create_session` | Create session file in `SESSIONS_DIR`, return token |
| `qm_validate_session <token>` | Check token exists, is valid hex, and is not expired |
| `qm_destroy_session <token>` | Remove session file |
| `qm_cleanup_sessions` | Remove expired session files (called on login) |
| `qm_check_rate_limit` | Check if caller is rate-limited; sets `RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_AFTER` |
| `qm_record_failed_attempt` | Increment failed attempt counter |
| `qm_clear_attempts` | Clear rate limit state |
| `qm_set_ssh_password <pw>` | Pipe password to `qmanager_set_ssh_password` via sudo |
| `require_auth` | Main auth gate; exits 401 if session invalid or setup required |

### 4.3 `cgi_base.sh`

HTTP headers, POST parsing, and JSON response helpers. Source this at the top of every CGI script. Automatically sources `qlog.sh`, `platform.sh`, and `cgi_auth.sh`. Automatically calls `require_auth` unless `_SKIP_AUTH=1` is set before sourcing.

```sh
# Standard CGI header
_SKIP_AUTH=1   # set only for auth/* endpoints
. /usr/lib/qmanager/cgi_base.sh
```

PATH is exported at source time to include `/opt/bin:/opt/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `cgi_headers` | Emit `Content-Type: application/json` + CORS + blank line |
| `cgi_handle_options` | Exit 0 immediately for OPTIONS (CORS preflight) |
| `cgi_read_post` | Read stdin into `$POST_DATA` using `$CONTENT_LENGTH`; exits on empty body |
| `cgi_method_not_allowed` | Emit 405 JSON and exit |
| `cgi_success` | Emit `{"success":true}` |
| `cgi_error <code> <detail>` | Emit `{"success":false,"error":$code,"detail":$detail}` |
| `cgi_reboot_response` | Emit success, then async-wait for `/tmp/qmanager_reboot_ack` (up to `$QM_REBOOT_ACK_TIMEOUT`s, default 20) before issuing reboot via `run_reboot`. See [§4.3.1 Reboot Ack Handshake](#431-reboot-ack-handshake). |
| `serve_ndjson_as_array <file>` | Serve an NDJSON file as a JSON array; emits `[]` if missing |

#### 4.3.1 Reboot Ack Handshake

Any CGI endpoint that triggers a reboot must call `cgi_reboot_response` — never inline `( sleep N && reboot )`. The helper coordinates with the static `/reboot/` page so the device only reboots **after** the countdown UI is in browser memory; otherwise lighttpd dies mid-serve and the user gets a connection-reset error instead of a countdown.

The contract:

1. CGI emits `{"success":true}` and forks a background block that polls `/tmp/qmanager_reboot_ack` once a second.
2. Frontend redirects to `/reboot/` on save success (see the [Reboot Navigation Pattern](FRONTEND.md#reboot-navigation-pattern) in FRONTEND.md).
3. The `/reboot/` page (`components/reboot/reboot-countdown.tsx`) fires `GET /cgi-bin/quecmanager/system/update.sh?action=reboot_ack` on mount, which creates `/tmp/qmanager_reboot_ack`.
4. The CGI background block sees the ack file, removes it, sleeps `$QM_REBOOT_POST_ACK_DELAY` seconds, then calls `run_reboot`.
5. If the user closed the tab or a non-UI caller invoked the endpoint, the wait is bounded — the reboot fires after `$QM_REBOOT_ACK_TIMEOUT` seconds regardless. The contract cannot hang.

Tunables (export before sourcing or before the call):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `QM_REBOOT_ACK_TIMEOUT` | `20` | Max seconds to wait for the ack file before forcing reboot. Matches the OTA worker's `REBOOT_ACK_TIMEOUT` in `qmanager_update` so every reboot path shares one budget. |
| `QM_REBOOT_POST_ACK_DELAY` | `1` | Grace seconds after ack is received, before `run_reboot` runs. Lets the browser finish painting the countdown's initial frame. |

The OTA worker (`qmanager_update`) is **not** a CGI and reaches reboot via its own ack-wait loop using the same file. Both paths use the same 20s budget so user expectations match wherever the reboot was triggered.

### 4.4 `config.sh`

File-backed key-value config store. Replaces UCI for RM520N-GL. Config file: `/etc/qmanager/qmanager.conf` (JSON). Sections: `watchcat`, `bridge_monitor`, `eth_link`, `settings`, `update`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `qm_config_init` | Create default config file if missing or empty |
| `qm_config_get <section> <key> [default]` | Read a value; returns default if missing |
| `qm_config_set <section> <key> <value>` | Write a value atomically (numeric values stored as numbers) |
| `qm_config_section <section>` | Return entire section as a JSON object |

**Note on `qm_config_get` and `false`:** Uses `// empty` which treats `false` as absent. All values in this config are strings or integers, never boolean `false`, so this is safe. If a future field needs boolean `false`, use the explicit null-check pattern instead.

### 4.5 `email_alerts.sh`

Email alert library. Sourced by `qmanager_poller`. Tracks internet downtime; sends recovery emails via `msmtp` when downtime exceeds the configured threshold.

Config: `/etc/qmanager/email_alerts.json`. Log: `/tmp/qmanager_email_log.json` (NDJSON, max 100 entries). msmtp config: `/etc/qmanager/msmtprc`. Reload flag: `/tmp/qmanager_email_reload`.

**Critical:** The generated `msmtprc` must NOT include a `logfile` directive. msmtp returns rc=1 if it cannot write its log, even when the email sends successfully.

msmtp binary is detected at source time from `/opt/bin/msmtp` (Entware) or `/usr/bin/msmtp`.

Recovery emails wait 30 seconds after connectivity returns before the first send attempt (DNS/SMTP stabilisation). Up to 3 send attempts with 15-second retries between them.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `email_alerts_init` | Read config; log enabled/disabled state (called once at poller startup) |
| `check_email_alert` | Main poll hook; check reload flag, track downtime, send recovery email |
| `_ea_read_config` | Read `email_alerts.json` into `_ea_*` state variables |
| `_ea_send_recovery_email <start_epoch> <duration_secs>` | Format and send HTML recovery email with retry logic |
| `_ea_send_test_email` | Send test email (called by CGI) |
| `_ea_do_send <subject> <html_body>` | Core msmtp send function |
| `_ea_log_event <trigger> <status> <recipient>` | Append NDJSON entry to email log |
| `_ea_format_duration <secs>` | Convert seconds to human-readable string (e.g., `1h 2m 3s`) |
| `_ea_build_recovery_html <start> <duration> <threshold>` | Build recovery notification HTML |
| `_ea_build_test_html` | Build test notification HTML |

### 4.6 `events.sh`

Network event detection library. Sourced by `qmanager_poller` and `qmanager_watchcat`. Detects state changes and appends NDJSON events to `/tmp/qmanager_events.json` (max 50 entries). Reads global state variables populated by the poller's AT parsers.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `append_event <type> <message> [severity]` | Append one event record to `$EVENTS_FILE`; trims to `$MAX_EVENTS` |
| `snapshot_event_state` | Snapshot current state into `prev_ev_*` variables |
| `detect_events` | Compare current vs previous state; emit events for all changes |
| `detect_data_connection_events` | Detect internet up/down and high latency/loss events (debounced) |
| `detect_scc_pci_changes` | Detect SCC cell handoffs via `$PCI_STATE_FILE`; called on Tier 2 refresh |
| `_ev_bands <tech> <cc_json>` | Extract compact band list from carrier_components JSON |
| `_ev_band_summary <tech> <cc_json>` | Build band + total bandwidth summary string |
| `_ev_ca_diff <tech> <prev_cc> <curr_cc>` | Compute added/removed bands; sets `_diff_added` / `_diff_removed` |
| `_ev_net_context` | Build short network context string from current globals |

**First-cycle behaviour:** `detect_events` populates `prev_ev_*` on the first call without emitting events. Set `events_initialized=false` at startup.

**Low power suppression:** All event detection is suppressed when `/tmp/qmanager_low_power_active` exists.

**Recovery suppression:** Internet events are suppressed while `$conn_during_recovery = "true"` to prevent spurious events during watchcat recovery actions.

### 4.7 `parse_at.sh`

AT command response parsers. Sourced by `qmanager_poller`. All functions take raw AT response strings and populate global state variables.

| Function | Populates | AT command |

### 4.8 `platform.sh`

Service control abstraction and sudo wrappers for CGI context. Detects whether caller is root (skips `sudo`) or www-data (uses Entware sudo at `/opt/bin/sudo` if available, else `/usr/bin/sudo`).

| `auto_apply_profile <iccid> [caller]` | Find profile, set active, spawn `qmanager_profile_apply` |
| `profile_check_lock` | Check if apply process is running; clean stale PID; sets `_profile_lock_pid` |
| `profile_acquire_lock` | Check + write PID to `PROFILE_APPLY_PID_FILE`; rc=1 if locked |

Profile JSON schema: `{id, name, mno, sim_iccid, created_at, updated_at, settings: {apn: {cid, name, pdp_type}, imei, ttl, hl, scenario_id}}`.

`settings.scenario_id` is optional (`""` = no binding). Valid values: `""`, `balanced`, `gaming`, `streaming`, or a `custom-<timestamp>` ID that exists at `/etc/qmanager/scenarios/<id>.json`. `profile_save` validates the field against this enum and rejects unknown values. See [`reference/sim-profiles.md`](reference/sim-profiles.md) for the binding semantics, gate matrix, and apply pipeline.

### 4.9a `scenario_mgr.sh`

Connection Scenario apply library. Sourced by `scenarios/activate.sh` and `qmanager_profile_apply`. Custom scenarios are stored at `/etc/qmanager/scenarios/<id>.json`; the active scenario ID is written to `/etc/qmanager/active_scenario`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `scenario_get_active` | Print the currently active scenario ID, or empty if none |
| `scenario_set_active <id>` | Write active scenario ID atomically via `tmp` + `mv` |
| `scenario_clear_active` | Remove the active scenario marker |
| `scenario_lookup_custom <id>` | For a `custom-*` ID, print the stored JSON; rc=1 if missing |
| `scenario_apply <id> [mode] [lte_bands] [nsa_nr_bands] [sa_nr_bands]` | Apply mode pref + optional band locks via `AT+QNWPREFCFG`. Built-ins (`balanced`/`gaming`/`streaming`) ignore the extra args and use hardcoded modes. Custom scenarios require `mode`. Returns 0 if `mode_pref` succeeded; sets `_scenario_apply_failed` to a comma-separated list of failed band sub-steps for partial-success detection. |

### 4.10 `qlog.sh`

Centralized logging library. Writes structured log lines to `/tmp/qmanager.log` with rotation and optional syslog forwarding.

Log format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] LEVEL [component:PID] message`

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `qlog_init <component>` | Set component name; create log directory |
| `qlog_debug <msg>` | Log at DEBUG level |
| `qlog_info <msg>` | Log at INFO level |
| `qlog_warn <msg>` | Log at WARN level |
| `qlog_error <msg>` | Log at ERROR level |
| `qlog_at_cmd <cmd> <response> [rc]` | Log AT command + response at DEBUG; truncates long responses to 200 chars |
| `qlog_lock <event> [detail]` | Log flock acquire/release/timeout/stale_recovery events |
| `qlog_state_change <field> <old> <new>` | Log state transitions at INFO level (only when old != new) |

Environment overrides: `QLOG_LEVEL` (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR, default INFO), `QLOG_FILE`, `QLOG_MAX_SIZE_KB` (default 256), `QLOG_MAX_FILES` (default 2), `QLOG_TO_SYSLOG` (default 1), `QLOG_TO_STDOUT` (default 0).

### 4.11 `semver.sh`

Semantic version comparison. Used by `qmanager_update` and `qmanager_auto_update`.

| Function | Exit codes | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `semver_compare <a> <b>` | 0=a newer, 1=equal, 2=a older | Compare two semver strings; strips leading `v`; handles pre-release labels |

### 4.12 `sms_alerts.sh`

SMS alert library. Sourced by `qmanager_poller`. Mirrors `email_alerts.sh` behaviour for SMS delivery via `sms_tool`. Shares `/tmp/qmanager_at.lock` with `qcmd` and the SMS Center CGI to serialize `/dev/smd11` access.

Config: `/etc/qmanager/sms_alerts.json`. Log: `/tmp/qmanager_sms_log.json` (NDJSON, max 100 entries). Reload flag: `/tmp/qmanager_sms_reload`.

**Registration guard:** Before every send attempt, `_sa_is_registered()` verifies that `modem_reachable="true"` AND (`lte_state="connected"` OR `nr_state="connected"`). Unregistered checks do not consume the retry budget (`_SA_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3`); they are bounded separately by `_SA_MAX_SKIPS=3` consecutive skips before deferring to the next poll cycle.

**Phone number format:** Stored with leading `+` in config; `+` is stripped via `${_sa_recipient#+}` before calling `sms_tool send` (sms_tool does not accept `+` prefix).

**Recovery deduplication:** If the downtime-start SMS was never sent (`_sa_downtime_sms_status != "sent"`), recovery emits a single combined message ("was down for X, now restored"). If the downtime-start SMS was sent, recovery emits a separate "recovered" message.

**CGI test send override:** CGI sets `_sa_is_registered() { return 0; }` after sourcing the library (the `_SMS_ALERTS_LOADED` guard prevents re-source clobber) because CGI context lacks poller globals.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sms_alerts_init` | Read config; log state (called once at poller startup) |
| `check_sms_alert` | Main poll hook; track downtime, attempt sends, handle recovery |
| `_sa_read_config` | Read `sms_alerts.json` into `_sa_*` state variables |
| `_sa_is_registered` | Check modem reachable + LTE or NR connected; return 0/1 |
| `_sa_flock_wait <fd> <timeout>` | BusyBox-compatible flock polling loop |
| `_sa_sms_locked [sms_tool_args...]` | Run sms_tool under the shared AT lock |
| `_sa_do_send <body>` | Send SMS with retry; returns 0=success, 1=failed, 2=not attempted |
| `_sa_send_test_sms` | Send test SMS (called by CGI) |
| `_sa_log_event <trigger> <status> <recipient>` | Append NDJSON entry to SMS log |
| `_sa_format_duration <secs>` | Convert seconds to human-readable string |

### 4.13 `system_config.sh`

System settings abstraction. Replaces `uci system.@system[0].*` for hostname and timezone. Sources `config.sh`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sys_get_hostname` | Read hostname from `qmanager.conf` -> `/etc/hostname` -> default `"RM520N-GL"` |
| `sys_set_hostname <name>` | Persist to `qmanager.conf`, write `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`, update `/etc/hostname` |
| `sys_get_timezone` | Read POSIX TZ string from `qmanager.conf` (default `"UTC0"`) |
| `sys_get_zonename` | Read IANA zone name from `qmanager.conf` (default `"UTC"`) |
| `sys_set_timezone <tz> [zonename]` | Persist TZ, symlink `/etc/localtime`, export `$TZ`, write `/etc/TZ` |

### 4.14 `tower_lock_mgr.sh`

Tower lock config CRUD, AT command builders, signal quality calculation, and failover watcher management. Sourced by CGI scripts and failover/schedule daemons. Config: `/etc/qmanager/tower_lock.json`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `tower_config_init` | Create default config if missing or invalid |
| `tower_config_read` | Cat config to stdout; falls back to embedded default on missing/invalid |

| `tower_config_update <jq_filter>` | Apply jq filter to config; atomic write via tmp+mv |
| `tower_config_update_lte <enabled> c1_e c1_p [c2_e c2_p [c3_e c3_p]]` | Update LTE lock cells in config |
| `tower_config_update_nr <enabled> pci arfcn scs band` | Update NR-SA lock params in config |
| `tower_config_update_settings <persist> <fo_enabled> <fo_threshold>` | Update persist + failover settings |
| `tower_config_update_schedule <enabled> <start> <end> <days_json>` | Update schedule config |
| `tower_lock_lte <num_cells> earfcn1 pci1 [...]` | Send `AT+QNWLOCK="common/4g"` |

| `tower_kill_failover_watcher` | Stop `qmanager-tower-failover` service |
| `tower_spawn_failover_watcher` | Check config, restart failover service, verify PID; prints `true`/`false` |
| `mtu_reapply_after_bounce` | Spawn background MTU re-apply watcher (polls up to 30s after interface bounce) |

### 4.15 `ttl_state.sh`

TTL/HL iptables rule management. Reads/writes `/etc/qmanager/ttl_state` (plain `TTL=N\nHL=N` format). Requires `platform.sh` to be sourced by the caller first (uses `run_iptables` / `run_ip6tables`).

TTL rules target `rmnet+` interface in `mangle POSTROUTING`. Replaces the legacy `/etc/firewall.user.ttl`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ttl_state_read_persisted` | Print `"<ttl> <hl>"` from state file; missing keys default to 0 |
| `ttl_state_read_live` | Print `"<ttl> <hl>"` from live iptables rules |
| `ttl_state_write_persisted <ttl> <hl>` | Atomic write to state file; removes file if both are 0 |
| `ttl_state_apply <ttl> <hl>` | Delete old rules, insert new rules; skips insert if value is 0 |
| `ttl_state_clear` | Apply 0 0 and remove state file |

### 4.16 `ethtool_helper.sh`

| `supports_2500` | Returns `true` if `eth0` advertises `2500baseT/Full`; `false` otherwise |

Caller must set `ETH_INTERFACE` before sourcing (default `eth0` in `ethernet.sh`).

---

## 5. Daemons & Utilities

### 5.1 Long-Running Daemons

These run continuously under systemd supervision.

#### `qmanager_poller`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_poller`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_status.json` (main cache), `/tmp/qmanager_signal_history.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_ping_history.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_events.json`
**Logs:** `/tmp/qmanager.log`

Main data collection daemon. Sources `qlog.sh`, `parse_at.sh`, `events.sh`, `email_alerts.sh`, `sms_alerts.sh` at startup.

**Polling tiers:**

| Tier | Interval | AT commands |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Tier 1 (hot) | Every cycle (~2s) | `AT+QENG="servingcell"`, `/proc` traffic stats |
| Tier 1.5 (signal) | Every 5 cycles (~10s) | `AT+QRSRP`, `AT+QRSRQ`, `AT+QSINR` |
| Tier 2 (warm) | Every 15 cycles (~30s) | `AT+QTEMP`, `AT+COPS?`, `AT+CPIN?`, `AT+QUIMSLOT?`, `AT+QCAINFO`, `AT+QNWCFG="lte_time_advance"`, `AT+QNWCFG="nr5g_time_advance"`, `AT+QNWCFG="lte_mimo_layers"`, `AT+QNWCFG="nr5g_mimo_layers"`, `AT+CGCONTRDP`, `AT+QMAP="WWAN"` |
| Boot-only | Once at startup | `AT+CVERSION`, `AT+CGSN`, `AT+CIMI`, `AT+QCCID`, `AT+CNUM`, `AT+QGETCAPABILITY`, `AT+QNWPREFCFG="policy_band"`, IPPT parsers |

Network interface for traffic stats is auto-detected: `rmnet_ipa0` on RM520N-GL (presence of `/etc/quectel-project-version`), `wwan0` on other platforms.

**System Health collection (`update_system_health()`):** Runs every Tier 1 cycle. Cheap reads only — no AT commands, no extra forks beyond `awk`/`grep`/`df`. Emits a top-level `system_health` block in the cache so the `system/modem-subsys.sh` CGI can serve it as a thin reader. Sources:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `state`, `state_raw`, `crash_count` | `/sys/devices/platform/4080000.qcom,mss/subsys0/{state,crash_count}` |
| `coredump_present` | Non-empty file under `/sys/devices/platform/4080000.qcom,mss/ramdump/ramdump_modem/` (sysfs metadata pseudo-files excluded) |
| `last_crash_at`, `total_logged_crashes` | `/etc/qmanager/modem_crashes.json` (NDJSON-style array; last entry's `ts` and `length`) |
| `cpu.load_1m` | `/proc/loadavg` (first column) |
| `cpu.core_count` | `nproc` (cached after first read — value never changes at runtime) |
| `cpu.usage_pct` | `/proc/stat` delta computed in `update_proc_metrics()` (the same value the rest of the cache uses) |
| `cpu.freq_khz`, `cpu.max_freq_khz` | `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/{scaling_cur_freq,scaling_max_freq}` |
| `memory.{total_kb, used_kb, available_kb}` | Derived from `device.memory_total_mb` / `device.memory_used_mb` (× 1024) |
| `storage.{mount, total_kb, used_kb, available_kb}` | `df -P /usrdata` |

The CGI reader (`/cgi-bin/quecmanager/system/modem-subsys.sh`) is now a thin `jq` extractor: it reshapes `system_health` into the historical response schema, falls back to an all-null shape if the cache is missing or older than 30s, and never re-implements live computation. Per-request cost dropped from ~80–120ms to ~15–25ms.

#### `qmanager_ping`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_ping`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_ping.json` (current state), `/tmp/qmanager_ping_history` (flat ring buffer)

The single source of internet reachability data. Probes two configurable HTTP/HTTPS targets on a 5-second interval using a primary-then-fallback strategy. Writes atomic JSON with `available`, `latency_ms`, `streak_ok`, and `streak_fail` fields. Does not touch the modem or AT device. Stats (avg/min/max/jitter/loss) are computed by the poller from the history file.

**Config:** `/etc/qmanager/ping_profile.json` — `profile` (sensitivity preset), `target_1` (primary), `target_2` (secondary).

Consumers: poller (reads `ping.json` and history), watchcat (reads `streak_fail` to drive recovery), frontend (reads via `status.json` merged by poller).

### Probe Targets

The ping daemon checks two targets in a primary-then-fallback strategy. Primary is probed every interval; secondary is only probed when primary returns `Disconnected`.

Both targets accept:
- Full URL: `https://example.com/path` or `http://example.com/path`
- Bare hostname: `youtube.com` (auto-prefixed to `https://youtube.com/`)
- Hostname with path: `example.com/health` → `https://example.com/health`

**Response interpretation:**
- For canonical captive-portal endpoints (`/generate_204`, `/hotspot-detect.html`): 204 = Connected, anything else = Limited (probable captive portal intercept).
- For custom URLs: any HTTP response (2xx–5xx) = Connected — the network path worked end-to-end. Limited state only triggers from canonical endpoints.

**Defaults:** `http://cp.cloudflare.com/` (primary), `http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` (secondary).

**Why these defaults:** Cloudflare's captive portal endpoint is reachable from most regions including networks that filter Google services (e.g. mainland China). Google's `gstatic` is the established fallback for everywhere else.

#### `qmanager_watchcat`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_watchcat`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.pid`, `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.lock`, `/tmp/qmanager_recovery_active`, `/tmp/qmanager_sim_failover`, `/etc/qmanager/crash.log`
**Config:** `qmanager.conf` section `watchcat`

Pure state machine. Reads `qmanager_ping.json`; never pings independently.

**State machine:**

```
MONITOR -> SUSPECT -> RECOVERY -> COOLDOWN -> MONITOR
          (LOCKED: maintenance mode, sleeps until lock removed)
```

**Escalation tiers:**

| Tier | UI Label | Action | Guard |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Re-register to Network | Network deregister/reregister (`AT+COPS=2/0`) | Enabled by default |
| 2 | CFUN Toggle | Radio toggle (`AT+CFUN=0/1`) | Skipped if tower lock active |
| 3 | SIM Failover | SIM failover (`AT+QUIMSLOT`) | Disabled by default; Golden Rule sequence |
| 4 | Reboot | System reboot | Token bucket: max N/hour; auto-disables if limit hit |

LOCKED state: set by touching `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.lock`. Watchcat sleeps until the file is removed. The update worker and installer touch this file during OTA operations.

### 5.2 On-Demand Daemons

These are started on-demand by CGI actions and stop when their task completes.

#### `qmanager_cell_scanner`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_cell_scanner`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_cell_scan.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_cell_scan.pid`

Runs `AT+QSCAN` (may take >60 seconds). Writes scan results with MCC/MNC lookups from `/usrdata/qmanager/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/operator-list.json`. Spawned by `at_cmd/cell_scan_start.sh`; polled by `at_cmd/cell_scan_status.sh`.

#### `qmanager_neighbour_scanner`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_neighbour_scanner`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_neighbour_scan.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_neighbour_scan.pid`

Runs `AT+QENG="neighbourcell"`. Spawned by `at_cmd/neighbour_scan_start.sh`; polled by `at_cmd/neighbour_scan_status.sh`.

#### `qmanager_band_failover`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_band_failover`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_band_failover.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_band_failover.pid`

Monitors signal quality and falls back to a configured backup band configuration when the primary drops below threshold. Spawned and stopped by `bands/failover_toggle.sh`.

#### `qmanager_tower_failover`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_tower_failover`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_tower_failover.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_tower_failover.pid`, `/tmp/qmanager_tower_failover`

Monitors signal quality against the tower lock failover threshold. When quality drops below threshold, clears the tower lock. Spawned by `tower_lock_mgr.sh`'s `tower_spawn_failover_watcher()` when failover is enabled. Configured via `tower_lock.json` section `failover`.

#### `qmanager_tower_schedule`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_tower_schedule`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_tower_schedule.pid`

Applies and removes tower lock on a time schedule. Reads `tower_lock.json` section `schedule`. Spawned by `tower/schedule.sh` when schedule is enabled.

#### `qmanager_profile_apply`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_profile_apply`
**State files:** `/tmp/qmanager_profile_state.json`, `/tmp/qmanager_profile_apply.pid`

Detached process spawned by `profiles/apply.sh`. Applies a saved profile to the modem in four steps (`STEP_NAMES="apn ttl_hl scenario imei"`):
1. APN -- `AT+CGDCONT` + full attach cycle (see [`reference/wan-profile-management.md`](reference/wan-profile-management.md))
2. TTL/HL -- iptables rules via `ttl_state_apply`
3. Scenario -- `scenario_apply` from `scenario_mgr.sh`; skipped if `settings.scenario_id` is empty; marks `skipped` with detail `"Scenario <id> no longer exists"` for a dangling custom reference
4. IMEI -- `AT+EGMR` + `AT+CFUN=1,1` soft reboot (most disruptive, applied last)

Scenario MUST precede IMEI: `AT+CFUN=1,1` reboots the radio, so any `AT+QNWPREFCFG` writes after it would be lost.

State JSON tracks current step, total steps (4), and per-step status (`pending`/`running`/`done`/`skipped`/`failed`). Polled by `profiles/apply_status.sh`. Singleton via PID file; `profile_check_lock()` guards against concurrent runs.

### 5.3 Boot Oneshots

These run once at boot via systemd oneshot units.

#### `qmanager_setup`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_setup`

Pre-create shared `/tmp` files with correct ownership for `fs.protected_regular=1`. Set `/dev/smd11` permissions. Ensure required directories exist. Initialize `qmanager.conf` defaults. Make all CGI scripts and binaries executable.

Key pre-creates (see §10 and §11 for the full list and rationale):
- `/tmp/qmanager_at.lock` -- `www-data:www-data` mode 666
- `/tmp/qmanager.log` -- `root:root` mode 666
- `/tmp/qmanager_sessions/` -- `www-data:www-data` mode 700

#### `qmanager_firewall`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_firewall`

Manages iptables rules restricting web UI access (ports 80/443) to trusted interfaces (`lo`, `bridge0`, `eth0`, `tailscale0` if installed). Invoked as `qmanager_firewall start` / `stop` by the systemd unit. SSH (port 22) is intentionally left open for emergency access.

#### `qmanager_imei_check`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_imei_check`

One-shot check that runs after boot if `/etc/qmanager/imei_check_pending` exists. Reads `/etc/qmanager/imei_backup.json` and verifies/restores IMEI settings. The systemd unit's `ExecStartPre` guards skip the service if the pending marker or backup file is absent.

#### `qmanager_mtu_apply`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_mtu_apply`

Apply custom MTU from `/etc/firewall.user.mtu` to `rmnet_data*` interface at boot. The systemd unit has `ConditionPathExists=/etc/firewall.user.mtu` so it is a no-op if no custom MTU is configured.

### 5.4 Cron-Driven

These are invoked by root's crontab entries written by CGI scripts.

#### `qmanager_scheduled_reboot`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_scheduled_reboot`

Performs a scheduled reboot at the configured time. Crontab entry written by `system/settings.sh` when `sched_reboot_enabled=1`. Config: `qmanager.conf` section `settings`.

#### `qmanager_auto_update`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_auto_update`

Checks GitHub for a newer release and spawns `qmanager_update install` if a newer version is available. Crontab entry written by `system/settings.sh` when `auto_update_enabled=1`. Config: `qmanager.conf` section `update`. Uses `semver_compare` from `semver.sh`.

**Note on low-power scheduling:** Low-power mode configuration (start/end times, days) is stored in `qmanager.conf` section `settings` and managed by `system/settings.sh` CGI. The flag file `/tmp/qmanager_low_power_active` is checked by `email_alerts.sh`, `sms_alerts.sh`, and `events.sh` to suppress activity during low-power windows.

### 5.5 Helper Utilities

These are invoked on-demand by CGI scripts via sudo, or interactively.

#### `qcmd`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qcmd`
**Lock file:** `/tmp/qmanager_at.lock`
**Depends on:** `atcli_smd11` (Rust, ARMv7 static binary), flock

The single entry point for all modem AT communication. Serializes access to `/dev/smd11` via `flock`. Uses `atcli_smd11` which accesses the device directly (no PTY bridge, no socat).

```sh
qcmd "AT+COMMAND"      # Returns raw response
qcmd -j "AT+COMMAND"   # Returns JSON-wrapped response
```

`atcli_smd11` always exits 0. `qcmd` detects errors by scanning the response for `ERROR`. Long commands (`QSCAN`, `QSCANFREQ`, `QFOTADL`) get a longer lock wait (10s vs 5s).

**Lock pattern:** `( flock_wait 9 $TIMEOUT; atcli_smd11 "$CMD" ) 9<"$LOCK_FILE"`

See §11 for the `flock_wait` polling pattern.

#### `qmanager_tailscale_mgr`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_tailscale_mgr`

Manages Tailscale VPN install/uninstall/status. Called via `sudo -n` from `vpn/tailscale.sh` CGI. Uses a two-layer execution pattern: outer wrapper stages an inner install script and a temporary systemd oneshot unit, fires the unit, then returns immediately. The inner script runs detached under systemd. Progress: `/tmp/qmanager_tailscale_install.json`. Log: `/tmp/qmanager_tailscale_install.log`. See CLAUDE.md section on Tailscale for detailed behavioral notes.

#### `qmanager_console_mgr`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_console_mgr`

Manages the web console (ttyd) service. Called via `sudo -n` from the console CGI. Controls `qmanager-console.service` via `svc_start`/`svc_stop`.

#### `qmanager_set_ssh_password`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_set_ssh_password`

Reads a new root password from stdin, hashes it with `openssl passwd -1`, and updates `/etc/shadow`. Called via `sudo -n` from `cgi_auth.sh`'s `qm_set_ssh_password()`. Invoked automatically during onboarding (syncs web UI password to root) and from System Settings.

#### `qmanager_reset_password`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_reset_password`

Resets the QManager web UI password. Interactive utility; typically invoked via SSH.

#### `qmanager_logread`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_logread`

Read and format log entries. Called via `sudo -n` from `system/logs.sh` CGI.

#### `qmanager_update`

**Location:** `/usr/bin/qmanager_update`

OTA update worker. See §12 for full pipeline description. Called via `sudo -n` from `system/update.sh` CGI. Runs as root; manages its own log at `/tmp/qmanager_update.log`.

---

## 6. Systemd Services

**Boot persistence model:** Boot persistence uses direct symlinks in `/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/`. `systemctl enable` does not work on RM520N-GL because unit files live on a partition where the `systemctl enable` mechanism cannot write. Use `svc_enable`/`svc_disable` from `platform.sh`.

**`UCI_GATED_SERVICES` pattern:** During upgrades, `install_rm520n.sh` only re-enables `qmanager-watchcat` and `qmanager-tower-failover` if their `multi-user.target.wants/` symlink existed before the upgrade. The variable is named `UCI_GATED_SERVICES` for historical reasons (RM551E had UCI-gated enables); on RM520N-GL the mechanism is purely symlink-presence detection with no UCI involvement.

| Service | Type | Binary | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| `lighttpd.service` | simple | `/opt/sbin/lighttpd` | Entware lighttpd; uses `/usrdata/qmanager/lighttpd.conf`; after `opt.mount` |
| `qmanager-console.service` | simple | `/usrdata/qmanager/console/ttyd` | Web terminal on `127.0.0.1:8080`, reverse-proxied at `/console` |
| `qmanager-firewall.service` | oneshot | `/usr/bin/qmanager_firewall` | Port firewall; runs before setup and lighttpd |
| `qmanager-imei-check.service` | oneshot | `/usr/bin/qmanager_imei_check` | Post-boot IMEI restore; guarded by `ExecStartPre` condition checks |
| `qmanager-mtu.service` | simple | `/usr/bin/qmanager_mtu_apply` | MTU persistence; `ConditionPathExists=/etc/firewall.user.mtu` |
| `qmanager-ping.service` | simple | `/usr/bin/qmanager_ping` | Ping daemon; required by poller |
| `qmanager-poller.service` | simple | `/usr/bin/qmanager_poller` | Main data poller; guards `/dev/smd11` in `ExecStartPre`; sources Data Used (schema v4, with per-boot orientation detection) from `/proc/net/dev` at the 2 s Tier 1 cadence |
| `qmanager-setup.service` | oneshot (RemainAfterExit) | `/usr/bin/qmanager_setup` | Permission setup; before ping and poller |
| `qmanager-tower-failover.service` | simple | `/usr/bin/qmanager_tower_failover` | Tower lock failover; guarded by config check in `ExecStartPre` |
| `qmanager-ttl.service` | oneshot (RemainAfterExit) | inline sh | TTL/HL rule persistence; `ConditionPathExists=/etc/qmanager/ttl_state` |
| `qmanager-watchcat.service` | simple | `/usr/bin/qmanager_watchcat` | Connection watchdog; guarded by `qm_config_get watchcat enabled` |
| `tailscaled.service` | notify | `/usrdata/tailscale/tailscaled` | Tailscale daemon; staged only -- see note below |

**`tailscaled.service`** is staged in `/usr/lib/qmanager/tailscaled.service` (source: `scripts/etc/systemd/system/tailscaled.service`). It is only copied to `/lib/systemd/system/` when the user installs Tailscale via `qmanager_tailscale_mgr install`. `ExecStartPost=/bin/chmod 755 /usrdata/tailscale` restores directory permissions after tailscaled resets them to 700.

**Service ordering:** `qmanager-firewall` -> `qmanager-setup` -> `qmanager-ping` -> `qmanager-poller` -> `qmanager-watchcat`.

**Rule annotations:**

| Rule | Used by |
|------|---------|
| `systemctl start/stop/restart/is-active *` | `platform.sh` `svc_start`, `svc_stop`, `svc_restart`, `svc_is_running`; all CGI scripts that control services |
| `ln -sf qmanager*.service` / `rm -f qmanager*.service` | `platform.sh` `svc_enable`/`svc_disable`; `tower/settings.sh`, `monitoring/watchdog.sh` |
| `iptables*`, `ip6tables*`, `*-restore` | `platform.sh` `run_iptables`/`run_ip6tables`; `network/ttl.sh`, `qmanager_firewall` |
| `/sbin/reboot` | `cgi_base.sh` `cgi_reboot_response`; `system/reboot.sh`; `qmanager_update` |
| `/usr/bin/crontab` | `system/settings.sh` (scheduled reboot, auto-update, low-power cron entries) |
| `qmanager_set_ssh_password` | `cgi_auth.sh` `qm_set_ssh_password`; `auth/ssh_password.sh` |
| `qmanager_tailscale_mgr` | `vpn/tailscale.sh` |
| `/usrdata/tailscale/tailscale` | `vpn/tailscale.sh` (status queries, `tailscale up`) |
| `/usrdata/tailscale/tailscaled --version` | `vpn/tailscale.sh` (installed version check) |
| `ln/rm tailscaled.service` | `vpn/tailscale.sh` (enable/disable Tailscale at boot) |
| `qmanager_console_mgr` | Console management via system settings CGI |
| `qmanager_update` | `system/update.sh` (OTA update; added in v0.1.5 -- previously required ADB/SSH) |

**Security note:** All rules use full absolute paths. sudo's `secure_path` is overridden by Entware's sudo configuration, but absolute paths in rules are immune to PATH injection regardless.

## 8. udev Rules

### Rule file: `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-qmanager-smd11.rules`

```
KERNEL=="smd11", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/lib/qmanager/qmanager_smd11_udev.sh"
```

**Purpose:** `/dev/smd11` defaults to `crw------- root:root` on boot. `www-data` (member of the `dialout` group) needs read/write access to run AT commands via `atcli_smd11`. This rule fires on every kernel `add` event for `smd11` and runs the helper which sets `chmod 660` + `chown root:dialout`.

**Why no `SUBSYSTEM==` filter:** The subsystem name for `smd11` is `glinkpkt` on RM520N-GL (sysfs path: `/sys/class/glinkpkt/smd11`) but differs on PRAIRE-derived platforms (RG502Q/RM502Q). `KERNEL=="smd11"` is already highly specific to Qualcomm SMD naming convention. Omitting `SUBSYSTEM==` makes the rule portable across platforms without verification.

**Why `99-` prefix:** Ensures this rule runs after OEM/vendor `data_udev_rules.rules`, overriding any permissions they set.

**Why `ACTION=="add"` only:** Prevents redundant firing on `change` and `remove` events.

### Helper script: `/usr/lib/qmanager/qmanager_smd11_udev.sh`

Runs in udev's minimal environment (no PATH, no controlling tty). Sets `PATH` explicitly. Checks `[ -c "$DEVICE" ]` before attempting chown/chmod. Always exits 0 to prevent udev log spam on race conditions. Source path: `scripts/etc/udev/scripts/qmanager_smd11_udev.sh`.

### Fallback: `qmanager_setup`

`qmanager_setup` runs the same `chown root:dialout /dev/smd11` + `chmod 660 /dev/smd11` at boot as a belt-and-suspenders fallback. This covers the case where:
- The udev rule has not yet been loaded (fresh install before `udevadm control --reload-rules`)
- The device was created before udev started
- PRAIRE-derived platforms where the modem recreates `/dev/smd11` after `qmanager-setup.service` completes

Both the udev helper and `qmanager_setup` are idempotent.

## 9. CGI Endpoint Reference

### Standard CGI Pattern

Every CGI script (except auth endpoints) follows this boilerplate:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. /usr/lib/qmanager/cgi_base.sh   # enforces auth automatically
qlog_init "cgi_<name>"
cgi_headers
cgi_handle_options

case "$REQUEST_METHOD" in
    GET)
        # ... read data, emit JSON
        ;;
    POST)
        cgi_read_post
        # ... process $POST_DATA
        ;;
    *)
        cgi_method_not_allowed
        ;;
esac
```

For auth endpoints that must skip authentication:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
_SKIP_AUTH=1              # MUST be set before sourcing cgi_base.sh
. /usr/lib/qmanager/cgi_base.sh
```

Authentication is automatically enforced by `cgi_base.sh` unless `_SKIP_AUTH=1` is set. CGI scripts never check auth manually.

For request/response schemas, see `API-REFERENCE.md`.

### Persistent Configuration (`/etc/qmanager/`)

Lives on the rootfs (read-only by default). `qmanager_setup` calls `mount -o remount,rw /` before writing. `/etc/qmanager/` is owned by `www-data` for CGI write access.

| Path | Description |

| `/etc/qmanager/email_alerts.json` | Email alert config (enabled, sender, recipient, threshold) |
| `/etc/qmanager/msmtprc` | msmtp config (generated on save; no `logfile` directive) |
| `/etc/qmanager/sms_alerts.json` | SMS alert config (enabled, recipient_phone, threshold) |
| `/etc/qmanager/imei_backup.json` | IMEI backup for rejection check restore |
| `/etc/qmanager/imei_check_pending` | Marker: IMEI restore pending after next boot |
| `/etc/qmanager/ttl_state` | TTL/HL values (`TTL=N\nHL=N`); absent = no rules |
| `/etc/firewall.user.mtu` | MTU setting script (sourced by `qmanager_mtu.service`) |
| `/etc/qmanager/long_commands.list` | List of AT commands treated as long (one per line) |
| `/etc/qmanager/crash.log` | Watchcat Tier-4 reboot log |

## 11. Locking & Concurrency Conventions

### `/tmp/qmanager_at.lock` -- AT Device Serialization

All processes that access `/dev/smd11` share this lock. Holders:
- `qcmd` (for all AT commands from the poller, CGI scripts, and daemons)
- `sms_tool` invocations in `sms_alerts.sh` (via `_sa_sms_locked()`)
- `sms_tool` invocations in `cellular/sms.sh` (via `sms_locked()`)

**Lock pattern (BusyBox `flock` lacks `-w`):**

```sh
# BusyBox flock lacks -w (timeout flag). Poll with -x -n in a loop.
flock_wait() {
    _fd="$1"; _wait="$2"; _elapsed=0
    while [ "$_elapsed" -lt "$_wait" ]; do
        flock -x -n "$_fd" 2>/dev/null && return 0
        sleep 1
        _elapsed=$((_elapsed + 1))
    done
    flock -x -n "$_fd" 2>/dev/null   # one final try
}

# Usage with FD 9 (read-only to satisfy fs.protected_regular=1):
( flock_wait 9 5 || exit 2; atcli_smd11 "$CMD" ) 9<"$LOCK_FILE"
```

**Why `9<` (read-only FD):** `fs.protected_regular=1` blocks `open()` for write on files owned by other users in sticky `/tmp`. Using `<` (read-only) instead of `<>` (read-write) avoids this restriction while still providing a valid file descriptor for flock.

### `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.lock` -- Maintenance Lock

A plain file (not a flock file). When this file exists, watchcat enters LOCKED state and suspends all recovery actions. Created by:
- `qmanager_update` (during OTA install)
- `install_rm520n.sh` (during installer run)

Cleaned up by watchcat's `ExecStopPost` and by `rm -f` in the update worker's EXIT trap.

### PID File Singleton Pattern

Long-running on-demand daemons use a PID file to prevent concurrent instances:

```sh
# Write PID at startup
echo $$ > "$PID_FILE"
trap 'rm -f "$PID_FILE"' EXIT INT TERM

# Check before spawning (from CGI or library)
if [ -f "$PID_FILE" ]; then
    pid=$(cat "$PID_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
    if pid_alive "$pid"; then
        # Already running
        exit 0
    fi
    rm -f "$PID_FILE"   # stale PID
fi
```

`pid_alive` checks `/proc/$pid` rather than `kill -0` because CGI (www-data) cannot send signals to root-owned daemon processes.

### Atomic JSON Write

All status/config files written with:

```sh
jq -n '...' > "${FILE}.tmp" && mv "${FILE}.tmp" "$FILE"
```

Never truncate-in-place. The `tmp + mv` ensures readers always see either the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial write.

## 12. Update Pipeline

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the operational flow (what a user does). This section documents the worker's internal behaviour.

### Worker: `qmanager_update`

Spawned by `system/update.sh` CGI via `sudo -n /usr/bin/qmanager_update <mode> [args]`. The CGI's spawn line redirects to `/dev/null`; the worker manages its own log as root.

#### Modes

| Mode | Arguments | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `install` | `<url> <version> [size]` | Download, verify, install, reboot in one step |
| `download` | `<url> <checksum_url> <version>` | Download and verify only; stage at `/tmp/qmanager_staged.tar.gz` |
| `install_staged` | (none) | Install a previously downloaded staged tarball |
| `rollback` | `<url> <version>` | Download and install a prior release; strict URL validation |

#### Status State Machine

```
idle -> downloading -> verifying -> ready        (download mode -- stops here)
idle -> downloading -> verifying -> installing -> rebooting
idle ->                             installing -> rebooting   (install_staged mode)
any  -> error                                                 (on failure)
```

Status written atomically to `/tmp/qmanager_update.json` via `write_status()`:

```json
{"status": "installing", "message": "Copying files", "version": "v0.1.5", "size": ""}
```

#### URL Validation

`validate_url()` enforces a GitHub origin whitelist:
- `https://github.com/tuanlongsav/QManager-VN/releases/download/*/qmanager.tar.gz` -- allowed in all modes
- `https://github.com/tuanlongsav/QManager-VN/raw/*/qmanager-build/qmanager.tar.gz` -- allowed in `install` mode only (not strict mode)

Rollback and download modes use `validate_url "$URL" "strict"` to permit only the releases path.

#### SHA-256 Verification

`download` mode downloads a checksum file and compares with `sha256sum`. Non-fatal if the checksum URL returns 404 or if `sha256sum` is unavailable.

#### Two-Phase VERSION Write

Prevents silent version mismatches when the installer crashes mid-flight:

1. `install_rm520n.sh` writes `/etc/qmanager/VERSION.pending` at the start of its preflight step.
2. On successful completion, it `mv`s `VERSION.pending` -> `VERSION`.
3. `post_install_check()` in `qmanager_update` verifies `VERSION.pending` does not exist and that `VERSION` matches the expected value. A stale `VERSION.pending` is treated as a crash indicator.

#### Step-Streaming Progress

Contract between the installer and the worker:

- **Installer:** `step()` function writes `=== Step N/M: <label> ===` lines to `/tmp/qmanager_install.log` via stdout redirect.
- **Worker:** `run_install_with_progress()` polls `/tmp/qmanager_install.log` every 2 seconds with `grep '=== Step '| tail -1`, parses the label via `sed`, and calls `write_status "installing" "<label>"`.
- **UI:** polls `/tmp/qmanager_update.json` for status changes.

#### Watchcat Lock During Install

`qmanager_update` stops `qmanager-watchcat` via `svc_stop` before downloading. Additionally, the installer touches `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.lock` as belt-and-suspenders to prevent watchcat from performing a Tier-4 reboot mid-install if watchcat was restarted by systemd during the operation.

#### Rollback Support

Before every install, `qmanager_update` writes the current version to `/etc/qmanager/updates/previous_version`. The CGI's rollback action reads this file to determine the URL for the previous release.

## 13. Development Guidelines

### Adding a New CGI Endpoint

1. Create `scripts/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/<category>/<name>.sh`.
2. Boilerplate:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   . /usr/lib/qmanager/cgi_base.sh
   qlog_init "cgi_<name>"
   cgi_headers
   cgi_handle_options
   case "$REQUEST_METHOD" in
       GET)  ... ;;
       POST) cgi_read_post; ... ;;
       *)    cgi_method_not_allowed ;;
   esac
   ```
3. Use `qcmd` for all AT commands. Never access `/dev/smd11` directly.
4. Use `jq` for all JSON construction. Never hand-build JSON strings.
5. Use `cgi_error` / `cgi_success` for response consistency.
6. Ensure LF line endings. Run `bash -n <script>` to syntax-check.
7. If the endpoint needs privileged operations, add a sudoers rule (see §7) and call the privileged binary via `$_SUDO /usr/bin/<helper>`.

### Adding a New Daemon

1. Create `scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_<name>`.
2. Source `qlog.sh` and call `qlog_init "<name>"` at startup.
3. Create `scripts/etc/systemd/system/qmanager-<name>.service`.
4. The installer's `enable_services()` function scans for service files and enables them automatically -- no installer edits needed.
5. If the daemon needs a PID file, use the PID file singleton pattern from §11.
6. If the daemon writes to `/tmp`, pre-create shared files in `qmanager_setup` with the correct owner and mode.

### Adding a New Sudoers Rule

When a CGI script needs to call a privileged binary:
1. Add `www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /full/absolute/path/to/binary [fixed_args]` to `scripts/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager`.
2. If the command takes variable arguments that cannot be narrowed, use the wildcard form (e.g., `/bin/systemctl start *`).
3. Prefer narrowing with fixed arguments where possible to limit the attack surface.
4. Do not use `sudo -i` or `sudo -s`; use `sudo -n /full/path` with explicit args.

### JSON Response Conventions

- Success: `{"success": true, ...additional fields}`
- Error: `{"success": false, "error": "<code>", "detail": "<human message>"}`
- Error codes are short snake_case identifiers (e.g., `validation_failed`, `not_found`, `modem_busy`).
- Never return HTTP error status codes; always return 200 with a JSON body.

### Logging Levels

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| DEBUG | AT commands, lock events, detailed flow tracing |
| INFO | Normal operations, state transitions, config changes |
| WARN | Unexpected state that is handled (stale PID, missing optional file) |
| ERROR | Failures that affect functionality (AT command failed, write failed) |

### Testing Locally

```sh
# POSIX syntax check
sh -n scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/config.sh

# Bash syntax check
bash -n scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_poller

# Check for CRLF
file scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_setup
# should say: "... shell script, ASCII text executable"
# NOT: "... CRLF line terminators"
```

## 14. Common Pitfalls

**jq `//` treats `false` as absent.** `jq -r '.enabled // "false"'` returns `"false"` even when `.enabled` is explicitly `false` in JSON. Use `if . == null then "false" else tostring end` for boolean fields. This pattern appears throughout the codebase and is documented in `config.sh` and `tower_lock_mgr.sh`.

**`fs.protected_regular=1` log-truncation failures.** If a CGI script (www-data) creates a `/tmp` file and a root daemon later tries to truncate it (e.g., `: > "$LOG_FILE"`), the kernel blocks the open. Fix: use `rm -f` before creating the file (as in `qmanager_update`), or pre-create the file with the right owner in `qmanager_setup`.

**CRLF in Windows-edited files.** `.gitattributes` sets `eol=lf` for `.sh`, `.service`, and sudoers files. If you edit with a Windows tool that bypasses git's filter, CRLF will silently break script parsing and sudoers. Check with `file <script>` before committing. The installer's `sed -i 's/\r$//'` pass catches this on deploy but the source should always be clean.

**Forgetting `sudo -n` in CGI invocations.** CGI runs as www-data. Any call to a root-required binary (iptables, systemctl, reboot, chown) without `sudo -n` will silently fail or produce a permission error that is hard to diagnose. Always use the `platform.sh` wrappers (`run_iptables`, `svc_*`, `run_reboot`) from CGI context.

**Inlining `( sleep N && reboot )` in a CGI script.** Two failure modes, both silent: (1) bare `reboot` runs as www-data and fails with "Failed to talk to init daemon" because systemd's private bus rejects unprivileged callers; (2) even if you wrap it in `run_reboot`, the fixed sleep races the `/reboot/` page — lighttpd is killed mid-serve and the user sees a connection-reset instead of the countdown. Always use `cgi_reboot_response` (see [§4.3.1](#431-reboot-ack-handshake)); it uses the sudo-aware `run_reboot` and waits for the page's ack file before pulling the plug.

**Trying to `systemctl enable` on RM520N-GL.** `systemctl enable` is a no-op on this platform because unit files are on the read-only rootfs where the command cannot write symlinks. Always use `svc_enable` / `svc_disable` from `platform.sh`, which writes the symlinks directly via `sudo /bin/ln -sf` and `sudo /bin/rm -f`.

**Writing to `/tmp/qmanager_*.json` from CGI without pre-creation.** If a CGI script creates a `/tmp` file that a root daemon will later overwrite, root will be blocked by `fs.protected_regular=1`. Pre-create the file in `qmanager_setup` with `www-data` ownership and mode 666 (or `root:root` mode 666 if root writes it primarily). See `qmanager_setup` for the full list of pre-created files.

**Hardcoding service lists in install/uninstall.** Use filesystem scans instead. `install_rm520n.sh` discovers services by globbing `scripts/etc/systemd/system/qmanager-*.service`. Adding a new service file is sufficient -- no installer edits needed.

**UPX-compressing `atcli_smd11`.** UPX self-modifying code causes segmentation faults on exit for this ARMv7 Rust build. Ship the uncompressed binary (~647KB). The installer must not UPX-compress it.

**Using `kill -0` for cross-user PID checks.** `kill -0 <pid>` fails with EPERM when www-data checks a root daemon's PID. Use `pid_alive()` from `platform.sh` which checks `/proc/$pid` existence instead.

### Platform Tooling Quirks (probe-confirmed 2026-05-09)

These quirks are easy to miss when porting code from a typical GNU/Linux box. Every item below was verified by direct SSH probing of the target firmware (`LE.UM.6.3.6.r1-02600-SDX65.0`).

**`bash` is 3.2.57.** Predates `mapfile`, `readarray`, `${var,,}`, `${var^^}`, `wait -n`, `declare -A`. See [§2 Critical Constraints](#2-critical-constraints) for the full list and workarounds.

**`/bin/sh` is BusyBox `ash`, not bash.** Do not put bashisms in `#!/bin/sh` scripts even if they "work locally" — they will fail on-device. Use `#!/bin/bash` if a script genuinely needs bash features.

**`sed` is BusyBox sed (1.31.1), not GNU sed.** Probe shows: `sed -i`, `sed -i.bak`, `sed -E`, `sed -r` all work. **Avoid:** GNU-specific `\<`/`\>` word boundaries, `sed -i ''` (empty SFX requires a non-empty arg or no arg at all), `sed --expression` long form. Stick to short flags.

**`awk` is BusyBox awk.** Probe shows `length()`, indexed arrays, `gensub()`, `systime()`, `strftime()` all available. Does **not** accept `--version` (silent stderr). For one-off scripts this is rich enough — but do not assume full gawk: `--posix`, `--re-interval`, GNU `printf %a`, `getline` over pipes with `|&` may behave differently.

**`tar` is BusyBox tar (1.31.1).** Only short flags: `c|x|t -ZzJjahmvokO -f -C -T -X --exclude`. **Missing:** `--owner=`, `--group=`, `--transform=`, `--newer-mtime=`, `--exclude-from`, `--mode=`. Backup/restore code that relies on these will silently misbehave or refuse the option.

**`xmlstarlet` is NOT installed.** Earlier docs imply `xmlstarlet` is the tool for `/etc/data/mobileap_cfg.xml`; **it is not present** on stock RM520N-GL. Use **`xmllint`** (`/usr/bin/xmllint`, system-bundled) for queries, or `sed`/`awk` for simple in-place edits. If a feature requires xmlstarlet, the installer must `opkg install xmlstarlet` from Entware first.

**`date` cannot do nanoseconds or relative-time parsing.**
- `date +%N` returns the **literal string `%N`** (no expansion). For sub-second timestamps, use `date +%s` (seconds only).
- `date -d 'now - 1 hour'` returns `invalid date` — BusyBox date has no GNU date-string parser. Compute offsets in shell: `$(( $(date +%s) - 3600 ))` and feed back via `date -d @<epoch>` (this **does** work).

**`mktemp --tmpdir=` is unsupported.** Use the template form: `mktemp /tmp/qmanager_foo.XXXXXX`.

**`ps -o etimes` is unsupported.** Only `etime` (HH:MM:SS string format) is allowed. To get elapsed seconds, parse `etime` in shell or read `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 (`starttime` jiffies) and subtract from `/proc/uptime`.

**`ss` is not installed.** Use `/opt/bin/netstat` (Entware net-tools) or BusyBox `netstat`. There is no `ss --version` to detect.

**No script interpreters beyond shell.** No `python`, `python3`, `perl`, `lua`, `node` — none. Anything that needs structured logic must be written as POSIX shell + `jq`. Adding an interpreter would mean an Entware package install (`opkg install python3`) plus its ~15 MB footprint on the persistent partition.

**No `getconf` for `ARG_MAX`/`PIPE_BUF`/`PATH_MAX`.** These names return empty on this device. Use Linux defaults: `ARG_MAX = 131072`, `PIPE_BUF = 4096`, `PATH_MAX = 4096`. If you need a real check, read `/proc/sys/kernel/...` directly.

**No NTP, RTC drifts to 1970.** `timedatectl` reports `System clock synchronized: no` and `NTP service: n/a`. Wall-clock time is set by the cellular network when it attaches; if the modem is offline at boot the clock can be years off. Never rely on absolute timestamps for security-sensitive ordering — use monotonic deltas (`/proc/uptime`) where possible.

**`/etc`, `/opt`, `/usrdata`, `/data`, `/cache`, `/persist`, `/systemrw` all bind-mount the same `/dev/ubi2_0` ubifs volume (~124 MB total).** Writes anywhere in this set consume from the same pool. `/tmp` is a separate 89 MB tmpfs (volatile). The rootfs `/` is `/dev/ubi0:rootfs` (~100 MB) — boots `ro`, must `mount -o remount,rw /` before persistent writes, then `sync` and `mount -o remount,ro /` before reboot.

**Single-core CPU, 178 MB RAM, ~91 MB zram swap.** ARMv7-A Cortex-A7 @ ~1.2 GHz (`BogoMIPS 38.40`) with VFPv4 + NEON + IDIVA/IDIVT. CPU-bound shell loops compete with the modem stack — keep daemon polling intervals reasonable and avoid per-second `jq` invocations on large JSON.

**`kernel.dmesg_restrict=1` and `kernel.kptr_restrict=2`.** Non-root cannot read kernel ring buffer; pointer values are zeroed in `/proc`. Diagnostic scripts that scrape `dmesg` will return empty under www-data.

**`conntrack_max = 12288`.** NAT table is small. Don't run conntrack-heavy probes (e.g., concurrent port scans) from the modem.

**Hardware-enforced binary ABI.** Native binaries shipped in `dependencies/` must be **armhf VFPv4** (Cortex-A7 features: `half thumb fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3 tls vfpv4 idiva idivt vfpd32 lpae evtstrm`). `armel` (soft-float) binaries will run but slowly; `aarch64` will not run at all.

**`iptables` rules live in a dedicated `QMANAGER_FW` user chain.** All web-UI port-firewall rules (ports 80/443 ACCEPT on trusted interfaces, DROP on others) live in the user chain `QMANAGER_FW` hooked from `INPUT`. `qmanager_firewall start` creates the chain (`-N`), flushes it (`-F`), populates the rules (`-A`), and hooks `INPUT` exactly once (`-I INPUT 1 -j QMANAGER_FW`). `qmanager_firewall stop` unhooks, flushes, and deletes the chain. This replaces an earlier direct-`INPUT` layout that left orphan rules across version drift (e.g. `DROP -i rmnet_data0 -p tcp --dport 80` rules from a prior trusted-interface set). Both `start` and `stop` also call `cleanup_legacy_input_rules()` to drain such orphans on devices upgrading from the old layout. Inspect with `iptables -L QMANAGER_FW -n -v` — single source of truth.
