# Custom DNS

> Custom DNS lets the user override which upstream resolver the modem's `dnsmasq` proxy forwards LAN client queries to. The feature edits a sentinel-delimited block at the end of `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf`, validates the result with `dnsmasq --test`, atomically swaps the file into place, restores its `radio:radio` ownership, and reloads `dnsmasq` via `SIGHUP`. No reboot, no DHCP-lease churn, no live restart of the daemon.

The feature ships on the `dev-rm520` mainline. Earlier `CLAUDE.md` listed Custom DNS in `Removed/Deferred Features` because the legacy RM551E/OpenWRT port wrote `uci set network.lan.dns=...`, which has no analog on the RM520N-GL. The underlying daemon (`dnsmasq`) is the same package; only the configuration mechanism (UCI vs. plain file edits) changed. See the "Why The Original Verdict Was Wrong" section at the bottom.

## Shipped Implementation

### GET response

`GET /cgi-bin/quecmanager/network/custom_dns.sh` returns the full current state in one round trip. The shape mirrors `CustomDnsSettingsResponse` in `types/custom-dns.ts`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "ignoreCarrier": true,
  "servers": ["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"],
  "dnsMode": "PROXY",
  "available": true,
  "currentUpstream": ["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"],
  "currentSource": "custom",
  "passthroughBypass": false,
  "blockCorrupt": false
}
```

Field semantics:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `enabled` | True when the sentinel block is present in `dnsmasq.conf` |
| `ignoreCarrier` | True when `no-resolv` is inside the block (dnsmasq ignores `/etc/resolv.conf`) |
| `servers` | User-configured upstreams, parsed from `server=` lines inside the block |
| `dnsMode` | Value of `<DNSMode>` in `mobileap_cfg.xml` (typically `PROXY`) |
| `available` | True when `dnsMode == "PROXY"`; gates all writes |
| `currentUpstream` | The live upstreams dnsmasq is forwarding to right now — from our block when enabled, otherwise from `/run/resolv.conf` |
| `currentSource` | `"custom"`, `"carrier"`, or `"unknown"` — explains where `currentUpstream` came from |
| `passthroughBypass` | True if IP Passthrough is bypassing dnsmasq for the passthrough host. Currently always `false` (see gotchas) |
| `blockCorrupt` | True when only one of the two sentinel lines is present (manual edit corruption). Exposed but no UI recovery yet |

When `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` does not exist at all, GET emits a minimal payload with `enabled:false`, `available:false`, and `error:"dnsmasq config file not found"`.

### POST request

Two actions are supported.

`action=save` writes the sentinel block:

```json
{
  "action": "save",
  "enabled": true,
  "ignore_carrier": true,
  "servers": "1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1"
}
```

`servers` is a comma-separated string. The hook (`hooks/use-custom-dns.ts`) joins the array before sending. The CGI splits on commas, trims each entry, validates IPv4/IPv6 syntax, and rejects past `MAX_SERVERS=4`.

`action=clear` removes the block entirely. The CGI internally rewrites this as `save` with `enabled=false`, falling back to carrier DNS:

```json
{ "action": "clear" }
```

Successful POST returns `{ ok: true, applied: <full GET payload> }` so the frontend avoids a follow-up refetch. Failed POST returns `{ ok: false, error: "...", field?: "servers" }`.

### Sentinel block format

Written verbatim by the CGI when `enabled=true`:

```ini
# QMANAGER-CUSTOM-DNS-BEGIN v1
no-resolv
server=1.1.1.1
server=1.0.0.1
# QMANAGER-CUSTOM-DNS-END v1
```

`no-resolv` is emitted only when `ignore_carrier=true`. Without it, dnsmasq merges our `server=` lines with whatever it reads from `/etc/resolv.conf` (carrier-assigned).

The `v1` version tag on each sentinel lets a future schema co-exist with an old block during upgrade.

### Apply pipeline

```
strip existing sentinel block from /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf
append new block (if enabled=true)
write candidate to /etc/data/qmanager/dnsmasq.conf.new          (www-data-writable; same UBI volume as dest)
dnsmasq --test --conf-file=/etc/data/qmanager/dnsmasq.conf.new
sudo /bin/mv /etc/data/qmanager/dnsmasq.conf.new /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf   (atomic rename within /dev/ubi2_0)
sudo /bin/chown radio:radio /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf
sudo /usr/bin/killall -HUP dnsmasq
```

The staging file lives inside `/etc/data/qmanager/`, a `www-data`-owned directory mode `0700` created by `install_rm520n.sh`. This is required because `/etc/data/` itself is owned by `radio:radio` mode `0755`, so `www-data` cannot create new files there. The staging dir must be on the same UBI volume (`/dev/ubi2_0`) as the destination so `mv` is a real atomic `rename(2)`, not a cross-filesystem copy+unlink that could leave a torn `dnsmasq.conf` if interrupted.

If `dnsmasq --test` rejects the candidate, the staging file is removed and the live config is untouched. If `mv` succeeds but `chown` fails, the save is allowed to proceed (logged as a warning) — the file still works, but QCMAP's future `sed -i` rewrites of `dhcp-option-force` lines may break if it cannot write the file. If `killall -HUP` fails, the new config is on disk but not live; the response reports this so the user can reboot to apply.

### Sudoers fragment

The CGI runs as `www-data`. Three NOPASSWD entries gate the apply pipeline (`scripts/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager`):

```
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mv /etc/data/qmanager/dnsmasq.conf.new /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/chown radio\:radio /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/killall -HUP dnsmasq
```

The `chown` rule has its colon backslash-escaped (`radio\:radio`). See "Sudoers colon-escape gotcha" below.

### Frontend

| Layer | Path |
|-------|------|
| Route | `app/local-network/custom-dns/page.tsx` |
| Card | `components/local-network/custom-dns/custom-dns-card.tsx` |
| Hook | `hooks/use-custom-dns.ts` |
| Types | `types/custom-dns.ts` |

The card shows the current upstream resolvers and source, an enable toggle, an "ignore carrier DNS" toggle (controls `no-resolv`), and a repeatable list of server inputs (max 4) with IPv4/IPv6 paste handling. When `available=false` (DNS Mode not `PROXY`) the card disables save and explains why. Field-level errors from the CGI are surfaced inline next to the offending input.

## Architecture Found On The Device

### dnsmasq is alive and authoritative for LAN DNS/DHCP

```
tcp 192.168.225.1:53            LISTEN 31285/dnsmasq
udp 192.168.225.1:53                   31285/dnsmasq
udp 0.0.0.0:67                         31285/dnsmasq
```

Build: `Dnsmasq version 2.91 ... IPv6 GNU-getopt no-RTC no-DBus no-UBus no-i18n no-IDN DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP no-conntrack ipset no-nftset auth no-DNSSEC loop-detect inotify dumpfile`.

Process invocation:

```
/usr/bin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/run/data/dnsmasq.conf.bridge0 --user=radio --group=radio
```

PPid = 1 (init/systemd). The standalone `dnsmasq.service` unit is `disabled / dead` and uses a different invocation; it is **not** the unit responsible. The real launcher is `QCMAP_ConnectionManager`, which spawns dnsmasq via the systemd template `dnsmasq_service@.service`:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/run/data/dnsmasq.conf.bridge%i --user=radio --group=radio
ExecReload=killall -HUP dnsmasq
```

### Config layering (the key insight)

```
/var/run/data/dnsmasq.conf.bridge0     <-- runtime, regenerated by QCMAP at boot
        |
        +-- conf-file=/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf      <-- persistent, our injection target
        +-- dhcp-leasefile=/var/run/data/dnsmasq.leases
        +-- addn-hosts=/etc/data/hosts
        +-- pid-file=/var/run/data/dnsmasq.pid
        +-- interface=bridge0
        +-- dhcp-script=/bin/dnsmasq_script.sh
        +-- dhcp-range=bridge0,192.168.225.20,192.168.225.170,255.255.252.0,43200
        +-- dhcp-option-force=6,192.168.225.1     <-- LAN clients are told "modem is your DNS"
        +-- dhcp-option-force=26,1500             <-- MTU
        +-- dhcp-option-force=120,abcd.com        <-- SIP server (Quectel default)
```

QCMAP rewrites *only* the `bridge0` runtime file at boot, plus known specific fields of `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` (`dhcp-option-force=6`, `26`, `120`) via targeted `sed` patterns. It does not rewrite arbitrary appended content. The `conf-file=` include means anything we add to `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` is parsed by every (re)start.

### Filesystem persistence

```
/dev/ubi2_0 on /etc      type ubifs (rw,...)
/dev/ubi2_0 on /usrdata  type ubifs (rw,...)
```

Same UBIFS volume — `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` is as persistent as anything under `/usrdata/qmanager/`. A shadow copy exists at `/usrdata/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` (factory backup); the running process does not read it.

### Upstream DNS path (modem's own resolver)

```
/etc/resolv.conf  ->  /run/resolv.conf   (tmpfs, ephemeral, rewritten at WAN bringup)
```

Writer: `QCMAP_ConnectionManager`. Implication: we cannot persistently override `/etc/resolv.conf` (QCMAP overwrites it on the next WAN bringup), but we do not need to — we override dnsmasq's upstream via `server=` + optional `no-resolv` instead, which is more correct anyway.

### mobileap_cfg.xml is not a DNS-upstream knob

```xml
<DNSMode>PROXY</DNSMode>
<APDNSProfile>1</APDNSProfile>
<EnableDhcpv4Dns>1</EnableDhcpv4Dns>
```

No `<CustomDNSServer>` field exists in the schema (`/etc/data/mobileap_cfg.xsd`). Editing `dnsmasq.conf` is the correct surface. `<DNSMode>` is read at GET time to gate availability: when it is anything other than `PROXY`, the dnsmasq proxy is bypassed and our edits would have no effect on LAN clients.

## Validation Performed

End-to-end validation on the live RM520N-GL (SSH credentials in `.env`):

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `GET` initial state — block absent | Returned `enabled:false`, `available:true`, `dnsMode:"PROXY"`, `currentSource:"carrier"`, `currentUpstream` populated from `/run/resolv.conf` |
| `POST action=save` with `1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1` and `ignoreCarrier=true` | Sentinel block written; `dnsmasq --test` passed; `mv`+`chown`+`HUP` all returned 0 |
| Post-save file inspection | `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf` owned by `radio:radio` (chown restored); mode `0644` (see gotcha); sentinel block present and well-formed |
| dnsmasq PID after HUP | Same PID before and after — `SIGHUP` re-reads config without restart, DHCP leases preserved |
| DNS resolution after save | `nslookup example.com` from a LAN client resolved cleanly via the new upstreams |
| `POST action=clear` | Sentinel block removed; `dnsmasq --test` passed; `HUP` succeeded; GET reported `enabled:false`, `currentSource:"carrier"` |
| Invalid IP rejection | `POST` with `servers:"1.1.1.999"` returned `{ok:false, error:"invalid IP address: 1.1.1.999", field:"servers"}` without touching disk |
| Empty server list when enabled | Returned `{ok:false, error:"at least one server is required when enabled is true", field:"servers"}` |
| Sudoers parse | `visudo -cf /opt/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager` returned `parsed OK` after the colon-escape fix |

## Known Gotchas & Lessons Learned

### Staging dir must be writable by www-data, on the same UBI volume as the destination

`/etc/data/` is owned by `radio:radio` mode `0755`, so `www-data` cannot create files there directly. The first release staged at `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf.qmanager.new` and granted sudo rules for `mv`/`chown`/`HUP` on that path, but never for the *creation* of the staging file itself. Every CGI invocation through lighttpd hit `EACCES` on the shell redirect (`{ ... } > "$STAGING_FILE"`) and returned `failed to write staging config file`.

The fix introduced a dedicated staging directory `/etc/data/qmanager/` owned by `www-data:www-data` mode `0700`, created idempotently in `install_backend()` via:

```sh
install -d -o www-data -g www-data -m 0700 /etc/data/qmanager
```

This keeps the staging file on the same UBI volume (`/dev/ubi2_0`) as `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf`, preserving the atomic-rename guarantee that `sudo mv` depends on. Cross-filesystem staging (e.g. `/tmp` tmpfs) would silently downgrade `mv` to copy+unlink and break the atomicity invariant.

### Always validate CGI under the actual www-data privilege context

The above EACCES bug shipped because Phase 5 validation was run as `root` over SSH (`_SKIP_AUTH=1 ... custom_dns.sh`), which created the staging file as root and bypassed the permission gap. `www-data` permission issues on file creation are invisible from a root shell.

Correct validation paths (any of these reproduce the real privilege context):

```sh
# A. Direct invocation under www-data's identity
sudo -u www-data env _SKIP_AUTH=1 REQUEST_METHOD=POST CONTENT_LENGTH=$(...) \
    /usrdata/qmanager/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/network/custom_dns.sh < payload.json

# B. Real HTTP through lighttpd (requires an authenticated session cookie)
curl -sk -X POST -b /tmp/qmanager.cookie \
    https://192.168.225.1/cgi-bin/quecmanager/network/custom_dns.sh \
    --data-binary @payload.json
```

Path A is fastest for shell-loop debugging and exercises the exact uid/gid/groups that lighttpd's CGI workers run under. Path B additionally exercises lighttpd's environment-stripping and request parsing. For any new CGI endpoint, Phase 5 must include at least Path A — root-shell validation alone is not validation.

### Sudoers colon-escape gotcha

The `chown` rule must be written as:

```
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/chown radio\:radio /etc/data/dnsmasq.conf
```

The `:` in the argument `radio:radio` has to be backslash-escaped because sudoers' grammar treats an unescaped `:` as the `user:group` separator inside any token in a rule's command. Writing the literal `radio:radio` makes sudoers parse it as a runas spec, which produces a fatal `sudo: parse error in /opt/etc/sudoers.d/qmanager` at the next sudo invocation — and because sudoers loads alphabetically, this single broken file disables sudo for every other rule in the directory.

This bit us during first install validation. The Phase 1 `installer-safety-auditor` audit approved the unescaped form because the audit does not run `visudo -cf` against the proposed line. Lesson for future installer-touching changes: the audit catches policy errors, but only `visudo -cf` catches grammar errors. The fix is committed.

**That lesson is now enforced in three places**, so the same class of error cannot reach a device again:

- `scripts/test/run-all.sh` §6 runs `visudo -cf` on the source file — fatal, and it is the first step of `bun run package`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the same gate before building, so a tag-pushed release cannot ship an unparseable file either.
- `install_rm520n.sh` validates a staged CRLF-stripped copy on-device and refuses to replace the working file if it fails.

See [BACKEND.md §7.2](../BACKEND.md#72-one-bad-drop-in-disables-every-rule) for the full gate table.

### File mode is 0644 after save (was 0664 baseline)

The post-save file is mode `0644`, not the original `0664`. Reason: the CGI's umask (`0022`) drops the group-writable bit when it writes the staging file, and `sudo mv` then `sudo chown` does not restore it. This is benign because QCMAP is the owner (`radio:radio`), so its `sed -i` rewrites of `dhcp-option-force` lines still succeed via owner-write rather than group-write. Worth noting in case a future change shifts ownership away from `radio` — at that point the group-writable bit would matter.

### `blockCorrupt` is exposed but not yet wired in the UI

When the sentinel block in `dnsmasq.conf` is malformed (e.g. a user manually edited one sentinel without the matching one), the CGI returns `blockCorrupt: true` and treats the block as absent. The TypeScript type includes the field. The card does not yet offer a "Repair / Clear stored config" recovery affordance — deferred polish.

### `passthroughBypass` always returns `false`

The CGI's `get_passthrough_bypass` helper currently returns the literal `false` with a `# TODO` comment. A robust extraction of the IP Passthrough + per-MPDN-rule DNS state from `mobileap_cfg.xml` was deferred. The field is in the type for forward compatibility; treat `false` as "no interop concern detected" rather than "passthrough is definitely off".

### PID file path divergence

The running dnsmasq writes its PID to `/var/run/data/dnsmasq.pid`, **not** the `/run/dnsmasq.pid` referenced by the disabled `dnsmasq.service` unit. The CGI uses `killall -HUP dnsmasq` (matching `dnsmasq_service@.service`'s `ExecReload`) rather than `kill -HUP $(cat /run/dnsmasq.pid)` for exactly this reason. Do not refactor toward the PID-file form.

---

## Why The Original Verdict Was Wrong

`CLAUDE.md` previously listed Custom DNS under `Removed/Deferred Features` with the reason *"UCI network dependency, no equivalent on RM520N-GL"*. That reasoning conflated *implementation mechanism* with *daemon presence*. The RM551E/OpenWRT port wrote `uci set network.lan.dns=...` and committed the UCI tree, which truly has no analog here — but the underlying DNS server (`dnsmasq`) is the **same package**, configured by file edits instead of UCI calls. The persistent partition layout (`/etc` on UBIFS) makes the file-edit approach as durable as the UCI approach was on OpenWRT.

Direct on-device probing (see "Architecture Found On The Device") established viability before any code was written; the implementation that shipped follows the layering this probing revealed.
