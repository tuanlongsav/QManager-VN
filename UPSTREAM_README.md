> **Note:** QManager is the successor to [SimpleAdmin](https://github.com/dr-dolomite/simpleadmin-mockup), rebuilt from the ground up with a modern tech stack and improved user experience. This branch targets the **Quectel RM520N-GL** modem running its internal Linux OS (SDXLEMUR, ARMv7l, kernel 5.4.180).

---

## Features

### Signal & Network Monitoring
- **Live Signal Dashboard** — Real-time RSRP, RSRQ, SINR with per-antenna values (4x4 MIMO) and 30-minute historical charts
- **Antenna Statistics** — Per-port signal breakdown with quality indicators for all 4 antenna ports
- **Antenna Alignment** — 3-position recording tool that compares composite signal scores to recommend best antenna placement
- **Network Events** — Automatic detection of band changes, cell handoffs, carrier aggregation changes, and connectivity events
- **Latency Monitoring** — Real-time ping with 24-hour history, jitter, packet loss, and aggregated views (hourly/12h/daily)
- **Connectivity Engine** — Configurable HTTP/HTTPS probe with primary-then-fallback, captive-portal detection, and a sensitivity preset (regions that block Google still come up clean by default)
- **Traffic Statistics** — Live throughput (Mbps) and cumulative data usage

### Cellular Configuration
- **Band Locking** — Select and lock specific LTE/NR bands for optimal performance, with automatic band failover
- **Tower Locking** — Lock to a specific cell tower by PCI, with automatic failover and scheduled changes
- **Frequency Locking** — Lock to exact EARFCN/ARFCN channels
- **APN Management** — Create, edit, delete APN profiles with MNO presets (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, etc.)
- **Custom SIM Profiles** — Save complete configurations (APN + TTL/HL + optional IMEI) per SIM, with auto-apply on SIM swap
- **Connection Scenarios** — Save and restore full network configuration snapshots
- **Network Priority** — Configure preferred network types and selection modes
- **Cell Scanner** — Active and neighbor cell scanning with signal comparison
- **Frequency Calculator** — EARFCN/ARFCN to frequency conversion tool
- **SMS Center** — Send and receive SMS messages directly from the interface
- **IMEI Settings** — Read, backup, and modify device IMEI, plus IMEI Generator & Validator (Luhn algorithm, TAC presets, imei.info lookup)
- **FPLMN Management** — View and manage the Forbidden PLMN list
- **MBN Configuration** — Select and activate modem broadband configuration files

### Network Settings
- **TTL/HL Settings** — IPv4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit configuration (iptables-based)
- **MTU Configuration** — Dynamic MTU application for rmnet interfaces
- **IP Passthrough** — Direct IP assignment to downstream devices

### VPN & Remote Access
- **Tailscale VPN** — One-click install, connect, and manage Tailscale mesh VPN directly from the UI; peer table, health warnings, boot persistence, and a one-toggle Tailscale SSH switch (gated by your admin-panel ACLs)
- **Port Firewall** — Built-in firewall restricting web UI (80/443) to trusted interfaces; Tailscale-aware, enabled by default

> **Note on the Tailscale SSH toggle:** QManager treats its SSH toggle as the source of truth and re-applies it on every reconnect, so it survives `tailscale up --reset`. If you carried a Tailscale install over from SimpleAdmin / the RGMII Toolkit, or you change SSH state via the `tailscale` CLI, the GUI won't see that change — and the next reconnect from the GUI will reset SSH back to whatever the toggle remembers. To resync after an out-of-band change, just toggle the switch off and on in the GUI once.

### Reliability & Monitoring
- **Connection Watchdog** — 4-tier auto-recovery: AT+COPS deregister/reregister -> CFUN toggle -> SIM failover -> full reboot (with token bucket rate limiting)
- **Email Alerts** — Downtime notifications via Gmail SMTP (msmtp), sent on recovery with duration details
- **SMS Alerts** — Downtime and recovery notifications delivered over the cellular control channel via `sms_tool`; reaches you even while the data link is offline. Registration-guarded retry with dedup collapse, threshold-based suppression of transient blips, bounded failure logging
- **Low Power Mode** — Scheduled CFUN power-down windows via cron
- **Software Updates** — In-app OTA update checking, download, verification, installation, and rollback
- **System Logs** — Centralized log viewer with search

### Interface
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Full theme support with OKLCH perceptual color system
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop monitors and tablets in the field
- **Cookie-Based Auth** — Secure session management with rate limiting
- **Web Console** — Browser-based terminal (ttyd) integrated into the UI with connection status, fullscreen mode, and dark theme
- **AT Terminal** — Direct AT command interface for advanced users
- **Initial Setup Wizard** — Guided onboarding for first-time configuration

---

## Prerequisites

- A **Quectel RM520N-GL** modem with RGMII Ethernet connectivity
- **Entware** installed at `/opt` (the installer will bootstrap Entware automatically if not present, but internet access is required)
- **ADB** or **SSH** access to the modem

> **Note:** QManager is fully independent — it does **not** require SimpleAdmin or the RGMII Toolkit to be pre-installed. The installer handles everything: Entware bootstrap, lighttpd, user/group creation, and service setup.

---

## Quick Install

ADB or SSH into the modem and run:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh \
  https://github.com/dr-dolomite/QManager-RM520N/raw/refs/heads/main/qmanager-installer.sh && \
  bash /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh
```

The interactive installer fetches the latest release, verifies the SHA-256 checksum, bootstraps Entware (if needed), installs lighttpd, deploys the QManager frontend and backend, configures systemd services, and optionally sets up SSH (dropbear). Bundled dependencies (`atcli_smd11`, `sms_tool`, `jq`, `dropbear`) are installed automatically. The SSH root password is automatically set to match the web UI password during first-time onboarding. A reboot is triggered after installation.

> **If `curl` isn't available on your modem** (common on x5x/x6x firmwares like RM502, RM520, RM521), install it through Entware first, then call it by absolute path so the BusyBox shell's default `PATH` doesn't trip you up:
>
> ```sh
> opkg update && opkg install curl
> /opt/bin/curl -fsSL -o /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh \
>   https://github.com/dr-dolomite/QManager-RM520N/raw/refs/heads/main/qmanager-installer.sh && \
>   bash /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh
> ```
>
> **If you have `wget` but not `curl`**, just use `wget` to fetch the installer — the installer's preflight will install `curl` from Entware automatically (Entware must already be bootstrapped) so future OTA updates work:
>
> ```sh
> wget -O /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh \
>   https://github.com/dr-dolomite/QManager-RM520N/raw/refs/heads/main/qmanager-installer.sh && \
>   bash /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh
> ```
>
> The QManager installer creates a `/usr/bin/curl` symlink during install, so subsequent commands and OTA updates pick up `curl` from the standard PATH without manual export.

### Upgrading

From v0.1.5+, go to **System Settings → Software Update** and use the built-in OTA update flow — download, verify, and install without SSH. Rollback to the previous version is available if needed.

> **Note:** The v0.1.4 → v0.1.5 hop requires ADB or SSH because v0.1.4's CGI lacks the sudo rule needed to invoke the update worker as root. From v0.1.5 onward, all future updates work via the UI.

### Uninstalling

```sh
# SSH into the modem
bash /tmp/qmanager_install/uninstall_rm520n.sh

# Skip the confirmation prompt (non-interactive / scripted use):
bash /tmp/qmanager_install/uninstall_rm520n.sh --force

# Skip automatic reboot after uninstall:
bash /tmp/qmanager_install/uninstall_rm520n.sh --no-reboot

# Also remove config/profiles/passwords and Tailscale:
bash /tmp/qmanager_install/uninstall_rm520n.sh --purge
```

Entware (`/opt/`) is always preserved even with `--purge` — remove it manually if needed.

---

## Additional Dependencies

- **Bundled with installer:** `atcli_smd11` (Rust reimplementation from [1alessandro1/atcli_rust](https://github.com/1alessandro1/atcli_rust), static ARMv7, AT command transport via `/dev/smd11`, works across RM502/RM520/RM521/RM551), `sms_tool` (ARM binary, SMS send/recv/delete with multi-part reassembly), `jq` (Entware package), `dropbear` (SSH server)
- **Downloaded during install:** `speedtest` (Ookla Speedtest CLI, ARMv7 armhf — downloaded from `install.speedtest.net`)
- **Installed from Entware:** `lighttpd` + `lighttpd-mod-openssl`, `sudo`, `coreutils-timeout`
- **Optional:** `msmtp` (email alerts) -- can be installed from within the app

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4, OKLCH colors, Euclid Circular B + Manrope |
| **Components** | shadcn/ui (42+ components), Recharts, React Hook Form + Zod |
| **Backend** | Shell scripts (Bash), CGI endpoints via lighttpd |
| **AT Commands** | `qcmd` wrapper with `atcli_smd11` on `/dev/smd11` (direct, no socat) |
| **Init System** | systemd (`.service` units in `/lib/systemd/system/`) |
| **Package Manager** | Bun (development), Entware opkg (device) |

---

## Architecture

```
Browser --- authFetch() --- lighttpd --- CGI Scripts --- qcmd --- atcli_smd11 --- /dev/smd11 --- Modem
                |                  |                       |
                |          Shell Libraries (12)      flock serialization
                |
        reads /tmp/qmanager_status.json
                |
         qmanager_poller
       (tiered polling: 2s/10s/30s)
```

The frontend is a statically-exported Next.js app served by lighttpd from `/usrdata/qmanager/www`. The backend is shell scripts running on the modem's internal Linux -- CGI endpoints for API requests and systemd-managed daemons for data collection.

**Key Data Flow:**

- **Poller daemon** queries the modem via AT commands every 2-30s (3 tiers) and writes a JSON cache file
- **CGI endpoints** (63 scripts) read the cache for GET requests, execute AT commands for POST requests
- **React hooks** (31 custom hooks) poll the CGI layer and provide loading/error/staleness states
- **AT transport** uses `atcli_smd11` on `/dev/smd11` directly (no socat PTY bridge needed)

**Platform Details:**

| Concern | RM520N-GL |
|---------|-----------|
| OS | Vanilla Linux (SDXLEMUR, ARMv7l, kernel 5.4.180) |
| Init | systemd |
| Root FS | Read-only by default (remounted RW when needed) |
| Persistent storage | `/usrdata/` partition |
| Web server | lighttpd (Entware) |
| Firewall | iptables |
| Config | Files in `/etc/qmanager/` |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 18+

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dr-dolomite/qmanager.git
cd qmanager && git checkout dev-rm520

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server (proxies API to modem at 192.168.225.1)
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
# Static export to out/
bun run build

# Full package (frontend + backend tarball + checksum)
bun run package
```

The `package` script builds the frontend, bundles it with backend scripts and dependencies into a tarball, and generates a SHA-256 checksum -- ready for distribution via GitHub Releases.
