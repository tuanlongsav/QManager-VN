## QManager-VN Fork

Đây là **QManager-VN** — fork cá nhân của [dr-dolomite/QManager-RM520N](https://github.com/dr-dolomite/QManager-RM520N) do [tuanlongsav](https://github.com/tuanlongsav) maintain. Khi làm việc trên repo này:

1. **OTA source of truth = `tuanlongsav/QManager-VN`** trên GitHub. Mọi URL liên quan đến install/update phải trỏ về đây, KHÔNG về upstream. Đã rebrand: `qmanager-installer.sh:19`, `scripts/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/system/update.sh:30`, `scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_update` (URL whitelist), `scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_auto_update:46`, docs URLs.
2. **Hardware target = SDXLEMUR family** (SDX62): RM520N-GLAA (primary tested, longht's hardware), RM520N-GL, RM520N-EU, RM502Q-AE, RM500Q-GL. Không phải single-target RM520N-GL như upstream.
3. **Fork roadmap** (xem `UPSTREAM_DIFF.md` để chi tiết phase):
   - **Phase B** — Cắt: Tailscale, Email Alerts, Web Console + AT Terminal, Discord Bot
   - **Phase C** — Auto-detect AT device (smd7/smd11) + auto-detect model/firmware + dynamic band whitelist + feature gating
   - **Phase D** — VN: SMS brand decode VINAPHONE/VIETTEL/MOBIFONE, phone normalize, VN APN presets
   - **Phase E** — Auto-cell-lock state machine, Simple Mode dashboard, gộp routes tương tự
4. **Reference source cho VN tweaks**: [tuanlongsav/quectel-rgmii-toolkit](https://github.com/tuanlongsav/quectel-rgmii-toolkit) branch `SDXLEMUR`.
5. **Upstream sync**: remote `upstream` trỏ về dr-dolomite. Pull bằng `git fetch upstream main`. Khi merge sẽ conflict ở các file đã rebrand — luôn ưu tiên giá trị fork (xem `UPSTREAM_DIFF.md` cho conflict resolution).
6. **Credit upstream**: README.md đã credit dr-dolomite. Đừng xoá credit. Donate links vẫn point về dr-dolomite — fork không có donate riêng.
7. **Checkout nằm trong `~/Desktop` do iCloud sync, và Ở LẠI ĐÓ** — user đã chốt, đừng đề xuất move repo nữa. Hệ quả: iCloud rải bản sao xung đột `<name> 2.<ext>` — snapshot cũ mà tool đọc như source thật. **Khi kết quả của tool mâu thuẫn với file đã commit, nghi bản sao trước khi nghi tool.** Hàng rào đã dựng sẵn, đừng derive lại: `scripts/dev/conflict-copies.sh` (phát hiện + dọn, cũng chạy trong `scripts/test/run-all.sh`); `scripts/dev/icloud-exclude.sh` (artefact tái tạo được thì **xoá cho build lại** dưới `.artifacts.nosync/` rồi symlink về — tuyệt đối không `mv` vào đó, `mv` nội dung iCloud đã index chính là thao tác đã làm mất 212 MB); pattern loại trừ trong `tsconfig.json` + `eslint.config.mjs` (không được rộng hơn regex của detector — rộng hơn nghĩa là tàng hình với cả hai hàng rào). Sau khi exclude, `node_modules`/`.next` là **symlink**: muốn cài lại phải xoá đích của symlink, `rm -rf node_modules` chỉ xoá cái link. Chi tiết ở `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## How to Use This File

This file is loaded into **every** session — keep it lean. Everything here is a **golden rule to follow**: the Communication Style, Design Context, and platform/backend truths below are non-negotiable and always apply.

Detailed feature and subsystem notes have been moved to `docs/reference/`. **Do NOT read those reference docs preemptively** — open one only when the current task actually touches that subsystem. Reading them "just in case" wastes context.

## Communication Style

When reporting findings, diagnoses, root causes, or explaining how something works, write so the user **learns alongside the fix** — not just expert-to-expert shorthand.

- **Lead with a plain-English summary** (one line) before the technical specifics. Example: "Short version: the CGI script can't see `jq` because lighttpd starts CGI scripts with a stripped-down `PATH` that doesn't include `/opt/bin`."
- **Briefly explain the *why*** behind the underlying mechanism — one or two sentences of context. Example: "lighttpd does this on purpose: untrusted CGI scripts shouldn't inherit the parent shell's environment, so it gives them a minimal one."
- **Define jargon on first use**: acronyms (CGI, RLS, RSRP, EN-DC), kernel/system terms (sysctl, udev, systemd target, journald), protocol terms (flock, PTY, WebSocket upgrade) get a one-clause gloss.
- **Use analogies** when they clarify ("`flock` is like a 'do not disturb' sign on the file — only one process can hold it at a time").
- **Keep it additive, not bloating.** Trivial answers ("yes", "the file is at X") don't need a tutorial. The rule kicks in for findings, diagnoses, post-mortems, code review, and architecture explanations.

This applies to all output that explains *what's happening* or *why* — bug investigations, debug session reports, audit findings, design rationale, and any "I traced this and found..." moments.

## Change Workflow

Every code-change request in this repo follows a tier-routed, 6-phase flow. Opus orchestrates; Sonnet subagents do the work. The user holds the approval gate. This flow is the project default for code changes and supersedes the generic brainstorming / writing-plans / verification skills; test-driven development still applies inside Phase 4 wherever tests exist.

**Signal each phase transition** with a header so the user always knows where we are: `**[Phase 1 — Triage]**`, `**[Phase 2 — Plan]**`, `**[Phase 3 — Approval]**`, `**[Phase 4 — Execute]**`, `**[Phase 5 — Validation]**`, `**[Phase 6 — Docs & Close]**`.

### The 6 Phases

1. **Triage & Findings (Opus):** Classify the request into Tier 0–4 by blast radius. If the change touches the installer, systemd units, sudoers, `/usrdata/` layout, or the OTA pipeline, dispatch `installer-safety-auditor` as a read-only Phase 1 gate. Synthesize findings.
2. **Plan (Opus orchestrates, Sonnet pre-flight):** For Tier 2+, dispatch builder agents on Sonnet in parallel (`ui-builder`, `cgi-endpoint-builder`). They return scaffolding + design notes, NOT committed code. Opus synthesizes into ONE plan: tier, agent roster, file list, build order, risks, post-flight validator list.
3. **Approval Gate (user):** Plan changes here are cheap; later changes are not.
4. **Execute (Sonnet workers):** Bottom-up for cross-layer work: poller → CGI → hook → component → alerts. Parallel where files are independent; sequential where there's data dependency.
5. **Post-Flight Validation (parallel Sonnet, ONE message):** Fire every applicable validator in a single message. Loop failures back to Phase 4 — but after **2 failed validation rounds**, stop and surface to the user instead of looping further.
6. **Docs & Close (Sonnet `docs-writer`):** Update `docs/` and CLAUDE.md as needed. Report summary + git status.

### Tier Routing

| Tier | Scope | Flow |
|------|-------|------|
| 0 | Typos, comments, copy edits, version bumps | Direct edit, no agents, no plan |
| 1 | Single existing file in one layer | Skip Phase 2–3. Implement + the layer's validator + maybe docs |
| 2 | New feature, single layer | Full flow; pre-flight is the layer's builder only |
| 3 | Cross-layer feature (CGI + hook + component, or a poller field consumed across layers) | Full flow; Phase 1 gate runs only if the change also touches installer/systemd/sudoers/OTA |
| 4 | Installer / systemd / sudoers / `/usrdata/` layout / OTA pipeline | Full flow with `installer-safety-auditor` as a hard Phase 1 gate before code is written |

Bug fixes match the tier of the *fix*, not the bug. Pure refactors with no behavior change drop one tier (validators still run; builders don't).

### Agent Roster

All agents are defined in `.claude/agents/` and run on Sonnet.

> **If `.claude/agents/` is missing, your checkout is incomplete** — the five
> agents are committed to the repo. Restore them with
> `git checkout origin/main -- .claude/ .gitattributes .github/` rather than
> working around their absence. When they genuinely cannot be dispatched, the
> validators map to `bash scripts/test/run-all.sh`, `bun run test:harness`,
> `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bunx eslint .`.

- **Gate (Phase 1, read-only):** `installer-safety-auditor` — audits installer/systemd/sudoers/OTA changes; can halt work before code is written.
- **Builders (Phase 2):** `ui-builder` (frontend pages/cards), `cgi-endpoint-builder` (backend CGI shell endpoints).
- **Validators (Phase 5, parallel):** `busybox-portability-checker` (shebang, line endings, BusyBox applet limits, 32-bit arithmetic), `installer-safety-auditor` (verify mode, for installer/systemd/OTA changes).
- **Closing (Phase 6):** `docs-writer`.

### Hard Rules

- **Tier is decided once, up-front.** If tempted to skip a validator mid-flow, re-triage rather than skip.
- **Post-flight validators always go out in a single parallel message.** Never serially.
- **`docs-writer` is the closing bracket.** If it doesn't run on Tier 2+, the change isn't done.
- **Sonnet workers don't see the orchestrator's conversation.** Each dispatch is a self-contained brief with file paths, schemas, and the relevant CLAUDE.md sections inlined.
- **The Phase 1 gate fails loud.** `installer-safety-auditor` can halt work before code is written. This is cheap; rework is not.

### Skip Phrases

User can short-circuit by saying "just do it" / "skip the plan" / "tier 0 it" — Opus drops to direct execution. Otherwise the flow is the default.

## Design Context

### Users
- **Hobbyist power users** optimizing home cellular setups for better speeds, band locking, and coverage
- **Field technicians** deploying and maintaining Quectel modems on OpenWRT devices
- Context: users are technically literate but not necessarily developers. They want clear, actionable information without needing to memorize AT commands. Sessions range from quick checks (signal status) to focused configuration (APN, band locking, profiles).

### Brand Personality
**Modern, Approachable, Smart** — a friendly expert. Not intimidating or overly technical in presentation, but deeply capable underneath. The interface should feel like a premium tool that respects the user's intelligence without requiring them to be a modem engineer.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual tone:** Clean and modern with purposeful density where data matters. Polish of Vercel/Linear meets the functional depth of Grafana/UniFi.
- **References:** Apple System Preferences (clarity, hierarchy), Vercel/Linear (typography, motion, whitespace), Grafana/Datadog (data visualization density), UniFi (network management UX patterns)
- **Anti-references:** Avoid raw terminal aesthetics, cluttered legacy network tools, or overly playful/consumer app styling. Never sacrificial clarity for visual flair.
- **Theme:** Light and dark mode, both first-class. OKLCH color system already in place.
- **Typography:** Euclid Circular B (primary), Manrope (secondary). Clean, geometric, professional.
- **Radius:** 0.65rem base — softly rounded, not pill-shaped.

### Status Badge Pattern
All status badges use `variant="outline"` with semantic color classes and `size-3` lucide icons. Never use solid badge variants (`variant="success"`, `variant="destructive"`, etc.) for status indicators.

| State | Classes | Icon |
| ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Success/Active | `bg-success/15 text-success hover:bg-success/20 border-success/30` | `CheckCircle2Icon` |
| Warning | `bg-warning/15 text-warning hover:bg-warning/20 border-warning/30` | `TriangleAlertIcon` |
| Destructive/Error | `bg-destructive/15 text-destructive hover:bg-destructive/20 border-destructive/30` | `XCircleIcon` or `AlertCircleIcon` |
| Info | `bg-info/15 text-info hover:bg-info/20 border-info/30` | Context-specific (`DownloadIcon`, `ClockIcon`, etc.) |
| Muted/Disabled | `bg-muted/50 text-muted-foreground border-muted-foreground/30` | `MinusCircleIcon` |

```tsx
<Badge variant="outline" className="bg-success/15 text-success hover:bg-success/20 border-success/30">
  <CheckCircle2Icon className="size-3" />
  Active
</Badge>
```

- There is no shared status-badge component — each card applies the classes above inline. `components/system-settings/system-health-check/health-status-badge.tsx` is the closest existing example to copy from
- Choose muted for deliberately inactive states (Stopped, Offline peer, Disabled); destructive for failure/error states (Disconnected link, Failed email)

### Design Principles

1. **Data clarity first** — Signal metrics, latency charts, and network status are the core experience. Every pixel should serve readability and quick comprehension. Use color, spacing, and hierarchy to make numbers scannable at a glance.
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Show the essential information upfront; advanced controls and details are accessible but not overwhelming. A quick-check user and a deep-configuration user should both feel served.
3. **Confidence through feedback** — Every action (save, reboot, apply profile) must have clear visual feedback: loading states, success confirmations, error messages. Users are changing real device settings — they need to trust what happened.
4. **Consistent, systematic** — Use the established shadcn/ui components and design tokens uniformly. No one-off styles. Cards, forms, tables, and dialogs should feel like they belong to one coherent system.
5. **Responsive and resilient** — Works on desktop monitors and tablets in the field. Degrade gracefully. Handle loading, empty, and error states intentionally — never show a blank screen.

### UI Component Conventions

- **CardHeader**: Always plain `CardTitle` + `CardDescription` without icons. Icons belong in badges or separate action areas, not in the card header itself.
- **Primary action buttons**: Use default variant (not outline) for main actions like Record, Save, Apply. Use `SaveButton` component for save-specific actions with loading animation.
- **Step-based progress**: Use `Loader2Icon` spinner + dot indicators for step/sample progress. Reserve fill/progress bars for data visualization (signal strength, quality meters) only.
- **Never sync fetched data into state with an effect.** `useEffect(() => setLocal(fetched), [fetched])` trips `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` and costs a second render pass per arrival — measurable on the modem's ARMv7 CPU. Pick by case: hold local edits as `null` and fall back to the fetched value during render (reset = `setEdit(null)`); key the child on the server snapshot to remount it (only against hooks that do **not** poll, or a refresh mid-typing wipes the form); or `useSyncExternalStore` for genuinely external state (localStorage, storage events, wall-clock time).

## RM520N-GL Platform

QManager targets the Quectel RM520N-GL modem, which runs **vanilla Linux internally** (SDXLEMUR SoC, ARMv7l, kernel 5.4.210) — NOT OpenWRT on an external host. The `dev-rm520` branch carried this work; it is now the mainline target.

### Live Device Access

A live RM520N-GL is reachable over SSH — **probe it whenever you can verify an architecture claim or assumption directly instead of guessing.** Credentials are in `.env` (`MODEM_IP`, `MODEM_SSH_USER`, `MODEM_SSH_PASSWORD`) — gitignored, local-only. Connect with the POSH-SSH PowerShell module (`New-SSHSession` / `Invoke-SSHCommand`). The device is the source of truth for platform facts; docs drift.

### System Differences

The table below contrasts RM520N-GL against the legacy RM551E (OpenWRT) target — useful when porting or reading older code.

| Concern | RM551E (OpenWRT) | RM520N-GL (Vanilla Linux) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Init system | procd | systemd (`.service` units in `/lib/systemd/system/`) |
| Config store | UCI | Files in `/usrdata/` (persistent partition) |
| Root filesystem | Read-write | UBIFS — read-only by default on stock boot (`mount -o remount,rw /`) |
| Shell | BusyBox sh (POSIX only) | `/bin/bash` available |
| Web server | uhttpd | lighttpd (Entware) |
| Firewall | nftables / fw4 | iptables direct |
| TTL interface | `wwan0` | `rmnet+` |
| Package manager | opkg (system) | Entware opkg at `/opt` (dedicated UBIFS volume) |
| LAN config | UCI (`network.*`) | `/etc/data/mobileap_cfg.xml` via xmlstarlet |

### Reference Docs

Read these only when working on the relevant subsystem:

- **AT command transport** (`atcli_smd11`, `qcmd`, SMS, flock serialization) — `docs/reference/at-command-transport.md`
- **QManager standalone install & runtime internals** (Entware bootstrap, udev permissions, CGI auth, service persistence, firewall, Tailscale, web console, email/SMS alerts, OTA pipeline) — `docs/reference/qmanager-independence.md`
- **Full platform architecture** (platform internals, Entware bootstrapping, lighttpd config, boot sequences, troubleshooting) — `docs/rm520n-gl-architecture.md`

**Source reference:** `simpleadmin-source/` contains the original RM520N-GL admin panel (iamromulan/quectel-rgmii-toolkit) for historical reference. QManager is now fully independent and does not require SimpleAdmin to be installed.

## Removed/Deferred Features (dev-rm520 Branch)

The following features have been **completely removed** from the `dev-rm520` branch. Their backend scripts, frontend components, hooks, and types no longer exist. Do NOT reference, modify, or create code for these features unless explicitly re-porting them.

| Feature | Reason | Scope of Removal |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| VPN Management (NetBird only) | Third-party binary, fw4/mwan3 dependencies | CGI, hooks, components for NetBird |
| Video Optimizer / Traffic Masquerade (DPI) | nftables dependency, nfqws ARM32 not validated | CGI, hooks, components, types, dpi_helper.sh, installer |
| Low Power Mode | Fully removed — daemons, plus the now-dead `save_low_power` CGI handler / `low_power_*` config defaults / event+SMS guards (the handler called deleted binaries and was unreachable from the UI) | qmanager_low_power, qmanager_low_power_check, settings.sh save_low_power |

## Feature-Specific Notes

Detailed operational notes for individual features live in `docs/reference/`. Read the relevant file only when working on that feature:

- **Antenna Alignment** (`/cellular/antenna-alignment`) — `docs/reference/antenna-alignment.md`
- **Custom DNS** (`/local-network/custom-dns`, dnsmasq upstream override via sentinel block in `/etc/data/dnsmasq.conf`) — `docs/reference/custom-dns.md`
- **Data Usage Counter** (kernel `/proc/net/dev`-sourced, schema v4 with per-boot dynamic orientation detection via 5 MB probe, `modem_reset_count`, `orientation_state`) — `docs/reference/data-usage-counter.md`
- **Ethernet Status & Link Speed** (`/local-network/ethernet`, Realtek RTL8125B 2.5GbE on `eth0` via `r8125` driver; reads link state from sysfs, speed/duplex from `ethtool`; speed limit applied via `qmanager_ethernet_apply` root helper; lib at `scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/ethtool_helper.sh`)
- **WAN Profile Management** (`scripts/www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/cellular/apn.sh`, 6 PDP contexts, AT-only, per-context `AT+CGACT` cycle) — `docs/reference/wan-profile-management.md`
- **Custom SIM Profiles** (4-step apply `apn → ttl_hl → scenario → imei`; `settings.scenario_id` binds a Connection Scenario; active profile gates APN / TTL/HL / Scenarios / Band Locking pages; `profile_managed` CGI guard) — `docs/reference/sim-profiles.md`

## Shared Constants

- **`ANTENNA_PORTS`** (`types/modem-status.ts`): Canonical metadata for 4 antenna ports (Main/PRX, Diversity/DRX, MIMO 3/RX2, MIMO 4/RX3). Used by `antenna-statistics` and `antenna-alignment`. Any new per-antenna UI must import from here — do not duplicate port definitions.
