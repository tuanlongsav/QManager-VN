// =============================================================================
// TypeScript interfaces and utility functions for the Tower Locking feature.
// Tower locking controls which specific physical cell the modem connects to,
// independent of band locking (which controls frequencies).
//
// Backend contract:
//   Status:          GET  /cgi-bin/quecmanager/tower/status.sh
//   Lock/Unlock:     POST /cgi-bin/quecmanager/tower/lock.sh
//   Settings:        POST /cgi-bin/quecmanager/tower/settings.sh
//   Schedule:        POST /cgi-bin/quecmanager/tower/schedule.sh
//   Failover status: GET  /cgi-bin/quecmanager/tower/failover_status.sh
// =============================================================================
